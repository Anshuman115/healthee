/// The shell every tab screen is built in: two sources, one list, one reveal.
///
/// ## Two sources, and neither may take the other down
///
/// The measured half comes from this phone's own store and renders with no
/// network at all (brief §7.4). The derived half comes from `/api/today`. They
/// are watched separately and fail separately, which is the whole reason the
/// screens are built this way:
///
///   * the server unreachable with nothing cached → the derived sections
///     collapse into ONE error card with a retry, and every measurement is still
///     on screen;
///   * the local store unreadable → that IS the screen failing, and it says so
///     with a retry rather than drawing a page of empty cards.
///
/// A page of twenty error cards would be the same news said twenty times, which
/// reads as breakage rather than as one connection problem.
///
/// ## A lazy sliver list and reveal-once
///
/// The list is a **`CustomScrollView` over lazily built slivers**, and the
/// [RevealRegistry] lives in this widget's `State`. Both halves are required and
/// neither works alone: laziness is what keeps a long list at 60 fps, and it is
/// also precisely what makes a chart's own `State` die on scroll and replay its
/// animation on the way back. `shared/reveal_once.dart` has the full argument,
/// and every ported painter takes its progress as a parameter for exactly this
/// reason.
///
/// **The restructure from `ListView.builder` did not touch that guarantee, by
/// construction.** `RevealOnce` never reads a scroll position, an index or a
/// viewport — it asks a registry that outlives the item whether this id has been
/// seen. `SliverList.builder` destroys items exactly as `ListView.builder` did,
/// so the mechanism is under the same pressure and answers the same way.
///
/// ## Why slivers, when a `ListView` was simpler
///
/// `richer.css` gives the chapter nav `position: sticky; top: 0`, and a header
/// that stays put while the list moves under it is a `SliverPersistentHeader` —
/// there is no other shape for it. A section declares
/// [PageSection.pinnedExtent] and this shell splits the list around it: an
/// ordinary run becomes one lazy `SliverList`, a pinned section becomes a header
/// between two of them. A screen with no pinned section builds exactly one
/// sliver and behaves as it always did.
///
/// **That registry is only worth anything while this `State` lives.** It used to
/// die on every tab switch, because each tab was its own page — so the rule held
/// inside a screen and was defeated between them. The tabs are branches of a
/// `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack` now (`shared/app_shell.dart`), which is what
/// keeps this object alive across a round trip.
///
/// ## No bar here
///
/// This widget draws no bottom bar and takes no tab index. There is exactly one
/// `AppTabBar` in the app and the shell owns it; five screens each drawing their
/// own was five chances to disagree. The `Scaffold` stays because `/diagnostics`
/// renders this shell **outside** the tab shell and still needs a page.
///
/// ## No app bar, and that is legacy's shape rather than a saving
///
/// `design_reference/project/hh/screen_today.jsx` starts each scroll with its own
/// header — an eyebrow, a display-size title, a theme toggle. A Material `AppBar`
/// saying "Sleep" above a bottom bar whose Sleep tab is already lit is the same
/// word twice and 56 px of the first screen spent on it.
///
/// ## Why this is shared rather than five copies
///
/// Today, Sleep, Activity, Coach and Diagnostics all render a list of cards over
/// the same two sources with the same failure rules. Standards §1: second
/// occurrence = extract. The screens that use it are now composition only — a tab
/// index and an ordered list of sections — which is what §3 means by "a screen is
/// composition of small widgets, not one God-widget".
