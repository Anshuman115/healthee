/// A screen's section list, written the way legacy writes one.
///
/// Legacy's screens are a single list literal with `SizedBox`es between the
/// cards:
///
/// ```dart
/// // healthee-legacy/app/lib/ui/today_screen.dart:246
/// if (_nums(spark['hrv_sleep_avg']).length > 2) ...[
///   const SizedBox(height: 10),
///   HModule(label: 'HRV · 14 days', …),
/// ],
/// ```
///
/// A `PageSection` carries its gap **after** it, so porting that literally means
/// writing each spacer onto the section before it — which is fine until the
/// section before it is conditional, at which point a `gap` written ahead of a
/// card that never appears leaves a stray band of nothing on the screen.
///
/// [SectionList.gap] resolves it: it sets the space under **whatever was last
/// added**, so the call sites read in legacy's own order (spacer, then card) and
/// a spacer emitted for a card that is never added simply lands on the card
/// above, which is exactly what legacy renders.
///
/// Extracted out of `features/today/` because Sleep, Activity and Insights are
/// the same list of the same literal, and three copies of this is three chances
/// for one of them to grow a different idea of where a gap belongs.
