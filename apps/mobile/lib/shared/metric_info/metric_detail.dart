/// What a card used to print on its own face, on its way to the ⓘ sheet.
///
/// ## The defect this type exists to fix
///
/// The owner, on the installed v02 build: *"that reference pill can we remove
/// those from cards please info sheets are for that"* and *"all these
/// unnecessary Sleep regularity long text and other texts in pills in
/// evrycard"*. Two reports, one shape: a card carrying its own **method and
/// provenance** — the reference it is read against, the sources behind it, the
/// paragraph explaining what the bars are — inline, under the number.
///
/// The ⓘ sheet already existed for exactly that material. What was missing was a
/// way to get a card's OWN, payload-derived provenance into it: [MetricInfo] is a
/// compile-time map, and `health.researchNotes` / `mvpa.weekTarget` /
/// `vo2max.standardErrorSource` are things only the payload knows.
///
/// So a card hands its head one of these, the head hands it to the ⓘ, and the
/// sheet renders it beside the static explainer. One destination for every kind
/// of long-form method text, which is what the owner asked for.
///
/// ## The rule that makes this a move rather than a deletion
///
/// **Nothing may be dropped on the way.** A claim whose grounding becomes
/// unreachable is a regression, not a tidy-up: it leaves a number on screen with
/// its licence removed. So every card that loses a citation must gain a reachable
/// ⓘ carrying it, and `MetricInfoDot` therefore draws itself for a card with
/// **no explainer at all** as long as this bundle is non-empty — an ⓘ that opens
/// a sheet holding only the sources is still the sources, reachable.
/// `test/features/card_provenance_test.dart` enumerates the cards and asserts it.
///
/// ## What does NOT belong here
///
/// A caveat signpost, a withheld reason, clinical routing, "not a diagnosis",
/// and the naming of the instrument behind a reading all stay **on the card**.
/// Those are not method detail; they are the qualifications that make the number
/// on the card readable at all, and this project has already fixed one round of
/// hiding them (`states/caveat_disclosure.dart`). The line is: text that
/// *teaches or describes* moves; text that *qualifies the number beside it*
/// stays.
