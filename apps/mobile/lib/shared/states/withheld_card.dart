/// How a refusal looks. The product's most careful moment gets its own widget.
///
/// `docs/APP_DESIGN_BRIEF.md` §1: *"When the data is not there, the API returns a
/// **withheld** block explaining what is missing and what would restore it, and
/// the app must render that as a **confident, designed state** — not an error,
/// not a spinner, not a greyed-out card that looks broken."*
///
/// Three things this widget will not do, all structural rather than conventional:
///
///   * **It never offers a retry.** A withhold is an answer, and the remedy is
///     the owner's ("log a weight", "wear the strap overnight"), not a button
///     that re-asks the same question. Retry belongs to `ErrorState`.
///   * **It never shows the reason id alone.** [Disclosure.message] is the point
///     of the block — the server writes it in the second person precisely so the
///     owner learns what would bring the number back. Rendering
///     `logged_weight_stale` at a person is telling them they are stuck.
///   * **It is not tinted.** Brief §2 rations colour to judgement, so a refusal
///     spends none: a [ValueHole] where the number would be, the reason in ink,
///     and the card frame unchanged from every other card. It reads as careful
///     because it kept the number's footprint, not because it is coloured.
