/// How a caveat is carried on a screen: a compact signpost, and the sheet behind
/// it.
///
/// ## The defect this file exists to fix
///
/// The owner, on the installed build: *"below the fitness card there is some
/// bullet points in raw text i dont think thats needed to be shown there"* and
/// *"Respiratory rate text is too big which makes the card too big"*. Both are the
/// same defect. `CaveatNote` used to print every disclosure in full, inline,
/// beneath whatever rendered the value — and the server's disclosures are essays:
/// the biological-age block in the committed contract snapshot carries **four of
/// them totalling ~2,780 characters** (the FRIEND-registry paragraph, the
/// measured-session paragraph, the questionnaire-conversion paragraph, and the
/// SRI exclusion). Today grew a page of prose under one card, and the Resp tile —
/// a fixed-shape grid cell — grew a 230-character sentence inside a 92 px body
/// and stopped matching the tile beside it.
///
/// `bio_age_card.dart` records that **legacy has no surface for caveats at all**,
/// so printing them in full was our addition, not the port. This file replaces the
/// carrier, not the honesty.
///
/// ## What replaced it, and the rule it must not break
///
/// A caveated value still discloses that it is caveated, in words, on the screen —
/// and the detail is still reachable, one tap away. What changed is that the
/// *detail* moved into a sheet. `docs/APP_DESIGN_BRIEF.md` §3 asked for exactly
/// this and `withheld_card.dart` used to say so while doing the opposite: *"an
/// unobtrusive marker on the number that expands — never a modal, never a badge
/// that demands attention"*.
///
/// **The failure mode is a caveat that becomes invisible, and it is worse than the
/// essay.** Two things are structural against it:
///
///   * [caveatHeadline] is the ONE sentence the carrier shows and it **counts
///     the disclosures**, so dropping one changes text that is on screen rather
///     than text nobody was reading.
///   * The carrier cannot render empty. [CaveatNote] asserts a non-empty list,
///     because "zero caveats" is [Present]'s job and a carrier that quietly
///     draws nothing is the silence this whole layer exists to prevent.
///
/// ## THE ASTERISK IS GONE — 2026-08-06
///
/// Owner, on the installed build: *"what are those * symbol in card"*. Exactly.
/// `CaveatMark` rendered a bare `*` in the module header and nothing anywhere
/// said what it meant, which **broke the rule this file's own docstring states
/// two paragraphs up**: a caveated value discloses that it is caveated *in
/// words*. An asterisk is not words. It was a glyph that could only be
/// understood by someone who had read this file.
///
/// The carrier says it in words now, and it is not a bare glyph:
///
///   * [CaveatNote] — the signpost with a line to spare. It sits **inside** its
///     card (`caveat_scope.dart` explains why that moved too), names the state
///     and counts the disclosures.
///
/// The header is left with **one** control, the ⓘ, which is what the owner
/// already understands. Nothing in a header row is now unlabelled.
///
/// ## THERE IS ONE CARRIER — v02
///
/// There were two. `CaveatFoot` was the fixed-height grid tile's, in legacy's
/// own foot voice at the bottom of the cell: `1 CAVEAT · TAP TO READ`. Its only
/// caller was `features/today/widgets/metric_tile.dart`, and the v02 redesign
/// replaced that grid with three summary tiles — so the foot, its
/// `caveatFootnote` string and the mutation that put the `*` back are all
/// deleted. One carrier was always the intent (`caveat_scope.dart` records that
/// the gutter version was a misattribution); it is now the only shape the code
/// can express.
