/// Reasoning **offered**, never forced — an inline disclosure, never a modal.
///
/// Brief §3: *"'Why debt is 120 minutes, not 1,400', 'What would restore this'
/// as an expandable, never a modal."* The distinction is the product's whole
/// posture towards depth. A modal stops the person reading their sleep and
/// demands they deal with a footnote; a line they can open is a footnote a
/// serious user will love and a casual one will never notice.
///
/// So this is an `ExpansionTile`-shaped thing built by hand, because Material's
/// own comes with a leading chevron, a divider, and a tap target sized for a
/// settings list — three pieces of chrome around one sentence.
///
/// It renders **inside** whatever card it belongs to and draws no frame of its
/// own: brief §2's first "never" is card-inside-a-card.
///
/// ## The answer goes through [GroundedProse], whoever wrote it
///
/// Most answers here are composed in Dart from typed fields and carry no
/// citation markers, so the parse is a no-op on them. One is not: a
/// recommendation's `rationale` is model prose that `jobs/recs.py` **requires**
/// to contain an inline `[note_id]` — it drops any rec whose rationale has none.
/// Routing every answer through the grounded widget rather than only that one
/// means a disclosure filled with server prose tomorrow is covered by
/// construction instead of by somebody noticing.
///
/// The same argument puts an ⓘ on the question row, carrying whatever the answer
/// cites. An answer composed in Dart cites nothing and the dot draws nothing, so
/// the cost of covering the general case is zero pixels on every surface that
/// does not need it.
