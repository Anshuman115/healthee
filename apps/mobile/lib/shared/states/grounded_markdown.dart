/// Generated prose that arrives as **markdown**, with its grounding intact.
///
/// ## Why this exists beside [GroundedProse] rather than inside it
///
/// The daily action is one sentence; `/api/sleep/insight` and
/// `/api/activity/insight` return several paragraphs of markdown — `**bold**`,
/// `* ` bullets and `**Header:**` lines. `renderInsightMarkdown`
/// (`healthee-legacy/app/lib/ui/ai_insight.dart:85`) is what draws them, and a
/// plain `Text` would print the asterisks. So the *structure* is legacy's,
/// verbatim: the same header/bullet/paragraph rules, the same sizes, the same
/// accent bullet dot.
///
/// [GroundedProse] stays a plain `Text` because that is right for a sentence, and
/// putting a markdown parser behind every `action` field would make the common
/// case pay for the rare one. Both take the **raw** string, and neither offers a
/// way to hand it a pre-stripped one — that rule is the point of both files.
///
/// ## Where the sources went
///
/// Underneath, until the owner asked three times for them off the card faces.
/// They are now in the ⓘ of the surface that draws this block, put there by the
/// same `groundingOf` this widget's parse comes from — see [GroundedProse]'s
/// docstring for why that move keeps the grounding as hard to drop as it was.
///
/// ## The one thing that is not legacy's
///
/// Legacy collected the `[citation]` markers itself and drew each as
/// `ct.replaceAll('_', ' ')` — `sleep_regularity_index` printed as "sleep
/// regularity index". That is an internal id with its underscores taken out, on a
/// health screen, presented as a source. Here the parse is
/// `data/honesty/citations.dart` (the server's own grammar, shared with every
/// other surface) and the chips are `CitationRow`'s, in the sheet, which resolve
/// each id to the corpus's own NAME and say so plainly when they cannot. That is
/// honesty wording, which is the one category of change this port allows.
