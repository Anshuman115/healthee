/// The evidence line under a claim: which sources back it, and how strongly.
///
/// ## Grades are shown only where the server sent one
///
/// This is the first rule the file exists to hold. `/api/today` carries a real
/// evidence grade in exactly one place — `recommendations[].evidence_grade`,
/// which `jobs/recs.py::_provable_grade` has already replaced with the weakest
/// grade among the notes the rec actually cites. Everywhere else the payload
/// carries `research_notes`: **citation ids, with no grade attached**.
///
/// So [grade] is optional and is never inferred from an id. Deriving one would
/// rebuild the `evidence_grade`-vs-`grade` split that once published a `Myth`
/// note as `Established` (#83) — a second grade that can disagree with the
/// first — and it would do it in the one layer with no access to the corpus.
///
/// ## A chip is a SOURCE NAME, never an id
///
/// It used to be the id: `recovery_readiness` under the gauge,
/// `cardio_load_trimp` on Activity. Those are internal identifiers, and a
/// snake_case string on a health screen is a log line where a source should be.
/// `shared/format/note_names.dart` resolves each to the corpus's OWN name — a
/// transcription, not a second opinion — and the id stays reachable in the
/// chip's tooltip for anyone debugging. An id this build cannot name keeps its
/// id and is logged: showing it is honest about the app being older than the
/// corpus, and inventing a title for it would not be.
///
/// Ids are rendered as chips rather than hidden behind a "sources" toggle,
/// because brief §4.5 is explicit: sources are a feature, not clutter. They are
/// not tappable yet — the note reader is a later screen — and a chip that looks
/// tappable and is not would be its own small lie, so they are drawn as stamps.
///
/// ## A personal finding is NOT a research note, and does not look like one
///
/// `[personal_finding:<name>]` is a pattern found in this one owner's history —
/// single-subject, observational, discovered by searching many metric pairs. It
/// arrives in the same brackets as a corpus citation and it is not one. So it
/// gets its own stamp, its own label, and [kSingleSubjectFraming] underneath:
/// the same sentence `findings_section.dart` puts above the findings themselves,
/// because the framing has to travel with the claim rather than live on one
/// screen that happens to show it.
