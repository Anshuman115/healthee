/// The instrument module — legacy's `HModule`, and the three parts inside it.
///
/// **Ported from** `healthee-legacy/app/lib/ui/ui.dart` (`HModule`, `HEyebrow`,
/// `HModuleValue`, `HFoot`), geometry unchanged:
///
/// ```text
///   ┌──────────────────────────┐
///   │ SLEEP                  ⓘ │  eyebrow 9 px / 0.12 em · the one control
///   │ 7:50 hrs                 │  figure 27 px, unit 10 px on the baseline
///   │ ▁▂▃▅▃▂▁                  │  the chart
///   │ DEEP 90  REM 90          │  foot, 9 px / 0.04 em, 8 px above
///   └──────────────────────────┘
///     14 px padding · squircle at r16 · 1 px border on the strong hairline
/// ```
///
/// ## What changed from the previous revision of this file
///
/// It was already a port, from the design bundle rather than from the Flutter
/// app, and three things had drifted. All three are now legacy's: **14 px**
/// padding (was 13), a **continuous-corner squircle** (was a rounded rectangle),
/// and **[HTap]'s press-scale** instead of an `InkWell` ripple — legacy's cards
/// scale to 97.5% under the finger and never ripple.
///
/// ## THE DOT IS GONE — owner-directed, 2026-08-06
///
/// *"can we remove that colored dots from cards"*. Legacy draws a 6 px mark in
/// the metric's own hue at the top right of every module, and this port drew it
/// too; **this is an owner-directed departure from the verbatim-legacy rule**
/// (`feedback_port_legacy_design_verbatim`), recorded here at the site.
///
/// Nothing became ambiguous by losing it, and that was checked rather than
/// assumed. Every module is still named by its eyebrow, and every module that
/// had a chart still tints that chart with the same hue. The pairs that could in
/// principle have collided were **already** colliding under the dot: legacy
/// makes `cHrv` and `cReady` the same green, so HRV, VO₂max, biological age,
/// MVPA and sleep health all wore one dot between them, and `cHeart` is the same
/// value as `alert`. The dot never separated those and does not now.
///
/// [tag] stays, and is no longer painted here. It is the module's **declared**
/// hue — the identity a card and the grid cell that opens it must agree on — and
/// it is what `test/features/moved_card_tags_test.dart` reads. Deleting it would
/// delete that guard's subject, not just a decoration.
