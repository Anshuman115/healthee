/// The app frame's bottom bar — **drawn once, by the shell**.
///
/// **Ported from** the bottom bar visible in every `design_reference/project/
/// screens/v2-*.png`: icon-over-label items on the app frame, the active one in
/// the accent, the rest quiet.
///
/// ## It no longer navigates by route, and that is the whole point
///
/// This widget used to call `context.go(tab.route)` and each screen drew its own
/// copy of the bar with its own `tabIndex`. Both halves of that were wrong:
///
///   * **Five copies of one bar** is five chances for them to disagree
///     (Standards §1: second occurrence = extract). The bar is now built in
///     `shared/app_shell.dart`, once, and no screen mentions it.
///   * **`go` to a sibling route rebuilt the screen.** Under plain `GoRoute`s
///     each tab was a fresh page, so a tab switch destroyed the scroll position,
///     re-ran every `RevealOnce` animation — defeating CLAUDE.md's replay rule at
///     the navigation layer, however correct the widget — and re-read providers.
///     The router is now a `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack`; this bar reports
///     which item was pressed and the shell moves the branch.
///
/// The active item is still not a link to itself: [onSelect] is called with the
/// current index too, and the shell reads that as "pop this tab to its root",
/// which is what a tab bar implies.
///
/// The tab list lives in `core/tabs.dart` because the router's branches are built
/// from the same list — see there for why they may not be two lists, and for why
/// the unbuilt Actions tab came out of the bar rather than being drawn dimmed.
