/// Personal findings — the app's most personal claim, and its narrowest.
///
/// **Moved out of `features/insights/widgets/` on 2026-08-05.** `/api/sleep`
/// returns its own `findings` array — sleep-scoped correlations from the same
/// `read/findings.py::_shape`, the same `Finding` model — and Sleep may not
/// import from Insights (Standards §3: nothing reaches into another feature).
/// Two features needing one widget is what `shared/` is for; the alternative was
/// a second copy of the wording rules, which is the one thing this file's
/// docstring spends four screens arguing against.
///
/// These are correlations discovered in **this one owner's** data. Brief §5.9
/// requires the label to say so, and it is not a disclaimer bolted on: the
/// finding was found by searching many metric pairs across one person's history,
/// so the sample size and the multiple-comparison correction are part of the
/// claim rather than footnotes to it.
///
/// So the wording is **"moved with"**, never "helps" or "improves". Those are
/// causal verbs and this is an observational n-of-1 — the exact over-reach the
/// whole evidence apparatus exists to prevent.
///
/// ## What this file used to render, and why it was wrong
///
/// It printed `Finding.description` as the headline. That field is the server's
/// `description_raw`, and `analytics/correlations.py::_pairwise_finding` builds it
/// like this:
///
/// ```python
/// desc = f"Spearman({a}, {b}) = {rho:+.2f} over {n} days (p={p:.3f})"
/// ```
///
/// which reached the owner's home screen verbatim as
///
/// > Spearman(hrv_sleep_avg, recovery_score) = +0.72 over 105 days (p=0.000)
/// > — they moved together
///
/// with a second line of `spearman_r 0.72 · over 105 days · same day · q = 0.000
/// after correcting for the search` under it. Two renderings of the same numbers,
/// neither of them a sentence.
///
/// The server's own read layer calls the shape it sends *"structured fields for a
/// plain-English card"* (`read/findings.py::_shape`) and names that string `_raw`.
/// The plain-English card is this file's job and it was not doing it.
///
/// ## What it renders now, and what did NOT change
///
/// The headline is the finding in the owner's language — which two metrics, which
/// direction — with one line of context under it for the window and the lag. The
/// coefficient, the correction, the lag in full and the raw server string are all
/// still here, one tap away behind [ReasoningNote], in the same spirit as the
/// VO₂max card's "Why this instrument, and not another".
///
/// **The honesty did not move.** The single-subject/observational framing is still
/// on the surface, above the findings, where it cannot be collapsed. No verb in
/// the rewrite is causal — the metrics are joined by "moved with" and "moved
/// opposite to" — and the disclosure repeats the point in its last paragraph so a
/// reader who opens it for the arithmetic gets the caveat with it. Trading the
/// caveat for readability is the one way this change could have made things worse.
///
/// Renders nothing when there are no findings. An empty heading over a blank card
/// reads as breakage; the honest state is silence.
///
/// ## The source chips moved to the ⓘ — 2026-09-07
///
/// The owner, for the second time: *"as i have stated previously to remove that
/// reference pills from everywhere it seems you forgot that"*. This file was the
/// one still drawing them, and because **Insights and Sleep both render it**, one
/// missed widget put chips back on two screens. That is why the sweep is now a
/// gate (`test/features/citation_sweep_test.dart`) rather than another pass.
///
/// Each finding's citations went into **its own** [MetricInfoDot], not a single
/// dot on the card: two findings on one card cite different notes, and one merged
/// sheet would tell the reader that either finding is backed by either source.
/// A finding citing nothing draws no dot — there is nothing behind it, and an
/// ⓘ opening an empty sheet is worse than none.
///
/// **[kSingleSubjectFraming] did not move.** It is not provenance; it is the
/// qualification that makes every headline on the card readable, and it stays on
/// the face where it cannot be collapsed.
