/// in a **finding**. A finding arrives as `metric_a: "hrv_sleep_avg"`,

/// So the ids get names here. The names are the ones the rest of the app already
/// uses for the same quantity — the sleep screen's "Overnight HRV" and this
/// table's must be the same words, or one metric has two names.

/// [metricName] returns the id unchanged when it does not recognise it. The
/// alternative — prettifying `foo_bar_baz` into "Foo bar baz" — invents an
/// owner-facing name for something nobody named, and it hides the fact that the
/// server grew a metric this app has never heard of. An id on screen is ugly and
/// legible as a gap; a manufactured phrase is neither.
