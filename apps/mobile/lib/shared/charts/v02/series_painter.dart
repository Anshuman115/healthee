/// The one painter behind the line chart and the sparkline — and the one
/// function behind those and the linked chart's panes.
///
/// ## Why they are the same painter and `HArea`/`HSpark` were not
///
/// `h_spark.dart` argues at length that it is not `HArea` with the fill turned
/// off, and it was right: those two disagreed about their **geometry** — one
/// padded its y-range by 18% and inset x by 4, the other used the full box — so
/// merging them would have meant one of the two silently changing shape.
///
/// v02 moved that disagreement into a value: [ChartMetrics]. The sparkline is
/// `ChartMetrics.bare` and the workhorse is `ChartMetrics.series`. Same curve,
/// same fill, same reveal — one difference, named and typed. That is a
/// parameterisation rather than a coincidence, and it means a fix to the curve
/// reaches the 26 px strip in a tile as well as the 168 px chart on a screen.
///
/// [paintSeriesInto] is the same argument one level down: the linked chart draws
/// two series into two lanes of one canvas and cannot be two `CustomPainter`s,
/// so the body-and-trace is a function taking a [ChartBox] rather than a method
/// taking a `Size`.
///
/// ## The reveal is two different animations on purpose
///
/// The **trace** wipes: the canvas is clipped to `progress` of the plot's width
/// and the stroke draws on left to right, which is time passing.
///
/// The **body** fades: its alpha scales with `progress`. A wiped fill has a hard
/// vertical edge, and a hard edge at 60% reads as *the series ends here* — which
/// is a claim about the data made by the animation.
///
/// The last-point dot is drawn **inside the clip**, so it arrives exactly when
/// the trace reaches it rather than pulsing at the far end of an empty plot.
