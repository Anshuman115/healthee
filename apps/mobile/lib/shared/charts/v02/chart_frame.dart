/// The whole file obeys one invariant, which `chart_box.dart` makes geometric:
/// words go in [ChartBox.values], [ChartBox.captions] and [ChartBox.bubble];
/// lines go in [ChartBox.plot]. Nothing here writes inside the plot.
///
/// ## Restraint is the design
///
/// The prototype dashes its gridlines (`stroke-dasharray: 3 4`). Dashes at 10 px
/// spacing on a 1 px rule read as texture, and texture competes with the trace.
/// These are solid, one pixel, in the palette's own [ChartInk.grid] — which is
/// `line` at half alpha and is not re-derived here, because the three painters
/// that each derived their own shipped the grid at five times its intended
/// weight.
///
/// A reference line keeps the prototype's dash, and there it earns it: the dash
/// is the only thing distinguishing *the owner's own baseline* from *a borrowed
/// convention*, a distinction `chart_reference.dart` argues at length and which
/// must not be carried by hue, because hue is rationed to judgement.
