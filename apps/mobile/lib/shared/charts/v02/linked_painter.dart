/// Two series, two scales, one hour — the geometry and the painter.
///
/// ## The scales are independent, and they are labelled
///
/// Heart rate is 40–140 bpm and stress is a 0–100 index. Forcing them onto one
/// axis would either flatten the heart rate into the bottom third or stretch
/// stress across a range it does not have; drawing them on two **unlabelled**
/// axes is worse still, because then the crossing point of the two traces looks
/// like it means something and it means nothing at all.
///
/// So each pane owns its axis, prints it in its own gutter, and the panes are
/// stacked rather than overlaid. What is shared is exactly one thing: **the
/// hour**. That is the claim the chart is making, and it is the only one it can
/// support — hence the caveat the widget carries under it.
///
/// ## Lanes, not a translate
///
/// Each pane is a [ChartBox] shifted into its lane, so everything is painted in
/// absolute coordinates. `ChartBox.shift` records why: a `canvas.translate`
/// would make a recorded-canvas assertion compare the bottom pane's rects in the
/// wrong frame, and the label-never-overlaps-data test would be measuring
/// fiction.
///
/// ## No bubbles here
///
/// The line chart puts its value in a bubble above the plot. This chart has two
/// values and one cursor, and two bubbles in two label bands would sit beside
/// the pane titles already written there. The readout row under the chart
/// carries both readings with their own colour keys instead — one place to look,
/// and the two numbers side by side, which is the comparison the chart exists to
/// support.
