/// [V02Hypnogram] — the night's stage timeline, drawn as one stepped ribbon.
///
/// The mark itself, and the pills-and-connector it replaced, are documented on
/// `HypnogramPainter`. This half is the chart's contract: the window is the
/// night's own, the hues are never handed in, and the axis is built here rather
/// than in the painter because it is the one part that needs a calendar.
///
/// ## The window is the night's own, not a fixed 450 minutes
///
/// The prototype divides by a literal `450` because its fixture is one 7½-hour
/// night. A real night that ran longer would draw off the right edge. The span
/// is the measured one — first start to last end — so the plot always ends
/// where the night did.
///
/// ## No hue is ever handed in
///
/// Stage hues resolve through `InstrumentHues.sleepStage`, the app's one stage
/// mapping (`core/theme/instrument_hues.dart`).
