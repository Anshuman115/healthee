/// The painter behind the bar chart and the intraday buckets.
///
/// Both are the same picture at two densities — a value per slot, standing on a
/// baseline — and the density is a number ([barFraction]), not a second painter.
///
/// ## Weight carries emphasis; hue never does
///
/// The prototype gives the current bar its own class and a different fill
/// (`--chart-strong` against `--chart-light`). In v02 those are the same family
/// at two alphas, and that is a rule rather than a shortcut: a past day is the
/// same metric as today, so it is the same colour, quieter. A different hue
/// would say it is a different kind of thing — and the three hues that *do* say
/// something (`fav`, `unf`, `alert`) are rationed to judgement, which "this is
/// the bar you are reading" is not.
///
/// ## A measured zero is not an unmeasured day
///
/// A `null` slot draws nothing at all. A slot measured as **zero** draws a
/// [_floorMark] — two pixels standing on the baseline. Without it the two
/// states are the same picture, and "you took no steps" would be indis-
/// tinguishable from "the strap was not worn", which is the exact confusion this
/// app exists not to create.
///
/// ## Labels that do not fit are dropped, not shrunk
///
/// Fourteen day labels under a fortnight of bars will not fit at 10 px, and 6 px
/// type is not a smaller label — it is an unreadable one. So the painter
/// measures, computes a stride, and labels every nth slot, anchored so that the
/// **last** slot is always among them: the current day is the one a reader looks
/// for. Each surviving label is centred in a slot it fits inside, which is what
/// makes "no glyph overlaps another glyph" true by construction rather than by
/// inspection.
