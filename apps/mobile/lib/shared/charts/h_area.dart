/// [HArea] — a smooth area + line with a draw-on reveal, scrubbable by touch.
///
/// **Ported from** `instrument_charts.dart`'s `HArea`. The painter's geometry is
/// unchanged: the same 0.18 y-padding, the same 4 px x-padding, the same
/// gradient from 32% alpha to nothing, the same crosshair-dot-bubble on touch.
///
/// Two changes, both required by this repo's rules:
///
///   * **`progress` is a parameter, not a controller.** See
///     `chart_primitives.dart` for the whole argument; the short version is that
///     an `AnimationController` in a `ListView.builder` item replays on every
///     scroll-back, which `CLAUDE.md` names as a hard rule.
///   * **Colours are roles.** `HColors.paper`/`paper2` became
///     [HealtheeColors.surface]/[HealtheeColors.ink]; the caller passes the line
///     colour, which is `accent` for the owner's own data everywhere it is used.
///
/// ## The third change, and it is the owner's (2026-08-06)
///
/// [references] — the horizontal lines this chart is read against. Legacy has
/// none, and their absence is what the owner's *"this graphs all look similar"*
/// report was really about; `chart_reference.dart` carries the whole argument
/// and the departure. With an empty list the geometry is byte-for-byte legacy's:
/// [ChartScale] is this painter's own scale extracted, and it only widens when a
/// reference asks it to.
