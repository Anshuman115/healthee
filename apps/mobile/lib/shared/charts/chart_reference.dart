/// What a series is READ AGAINST — the scale, the line on it, and its caption.
///
/// ## Why this file exists
///
/// Owner report, 2026-08-06, on the installed build: *"can we change the
/// heartrate, stress, hrv, blood oxygen graphs to be more meaningful ones, this
/// graphs all look similar."* They did, and the cause was structural rather than
/// cosmetic: all four were `HArea(series, color: tint, height: 52)` — a value
/// over time with **no reference**. Four different questions got one answer
/// shape, and none of the four answers could actually be read. 47 ms of HRV
/// means nothing without the owner's own normal beside it.
///
/// **This is an owner-directed departure from the verbatim-legacy rule**
/// (`feedback_port_legacy_design_verbatim`). Legacy draws no reference on any of
/// these four charts. Each card records the departure at its own site.
///
/// ## The rule that broke on the first attempt: A LABEL IS NOT INK IN THE PLOT
///
/// The first revision painted each reference's caption inside the plot box, just
/// above its line. Owner report on that build: *"heart rate is also looks wried,
/// same as blood oxygen you just made it bad."* Three charts shipped with the
/// label lying across the data — `YOUR 30-DAY NORMAL 53 MS` through the HRV
/// trace, `RESTING 56` on top of the hour captions, and a 55-character SpO2
/// sentence straight through the dots. Both the label and the data became
/// unreadable, which is strictly worse than the bare chart it replaced.
///
/// So [paintChartReference] draws **a line and nothing else**, and the caption is
/// a widget — [ChartReferenceCaption] — laid out under the chart where it cannot
/// collide with anything the painter drew. `test/features/vitals_labels_test.dart`
/// asserts that geometrically, in both themes, on all four cards: no glyph
/// overlaps a data mark and no glyph overlaps another glyph.
///
/// ## The one rule about the scale
///
/// A reference line is truthful only if it is drawn **in the same y-scale as the
/// series**, and only if that scale was widened to contain it. A resting-HR line
/// at 55 under a trace spanning 60–112 would otherwise clip to the bottom edge
/// and read as "you never went below your resting rate" — a false claim produced
/// entirely by layout. So [ChartScale.of] takes the reference values as
/// `include`, and a painter and its reference cannot disagree about where a
/// number sits.
///
/// ## Structure, not verdict
///
/// A reference is drawn in a quiet ink and **never** in `fav`/`unf`/`alert`.
/// `palette.dart` rations those three to judgement, and a line saying "here is
/// your normal" is not a judgement about the reading beside it. The two kinds
/// differ by **dash**, not by hue:
///
///   * [ChartReferenceKind.personalBaseline] — solid. The owner's own number, as
///     the **server** defines it. The client never computes one: `CLAUDE.md`'s
///     one-definition-per-metric rule is exactly what a second, on-device
///     baseline would break.
///   * [ChartReferenceKind.convention] — dashed, and its caption says so. A
///     borrowed line that is not a measurement of this owner at all. The
///     blood-oxygen ~92% is the live case: `wearable_spo2_validity` is explicit
///     that it is *"a clinical convention, not a wearable-validated cutoff —
///     none is sourced (#98)"*. Drawing it exactly like a personal baseline
///     would assert it as a fact about this owner's oxygen.
