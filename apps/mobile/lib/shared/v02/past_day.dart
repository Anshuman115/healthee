/// What a date-aware screen draws where a judgement it cannot date belongs.
///
/// ```css
/// .history-missing    { padding:20px; border:1px dashed var(--rule);
///                       border-radius:18px; margin:12px 0; }
/// .history-missing h3 { font-size:13px; }
/// .history-missing p  { font-size:11px; margin-top:8px; }
/// ```
///
/// `history-screens.js` opens every past-day screen with one of these, and the
/// dashed edge is the same load-bearing signal `withheld_panel.dart` argues:
/// every other v02 container has a solid hairline, so a visibly broken outline
/// is the one shape that reads as absence before a word is read.
///
/// ## Why the app needs it on more screens than the prototype does
///
/// The prototype refuses a past day's analysis because its fixture holds one
/// day of it. This app refuses for a structural reason and permanently:
/// `/api/today` and `/api/activity` take **no day parameter at all**, and
/// `/api/sleep` takes a window rather than a target day. So recovery, sleep
/// health, debt, VO₂max, biological age, the correlations and the day's
/// suggestion exist for the current day and no other — there is no request that
/// would produce yesterday's.
///
/// The alternative was to draw today's numbers under yesterday's date. That is
/// stale-as-current: the failure `LastKnown` exists for, the one `vo2max_tier`'s
/// freshness horizon exists for, and the one this repo has already swept three
/// times. So the screens say what is missing and why, which is also why this is
/// a *titled* block rather than a blank space — a screen that simply ends is
/// read as a bad day.
