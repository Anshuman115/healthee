/// ```css
/// .panel-head  { display: flex; justify-content: space-between;
///                align-items: center; gap: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px; }
/// .panel-title { display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 8px;
///                font-size: 13px; font-weight: 700; }
/// .panel-title > .icon    { width: 17px; height: 17px; color: var(--family); }
/// .panel .text-button     { color: var(--family); min-height: 28px;
///                           font-size: 11px; }
/// ```
///
/// The action is built here rather than accepted as a `Widget`, so its colour,
/// size and minimum height cannot be bypassed — the icon and the action are the
/// two places a panel's tone becomes visible, and a caller that passed its own
/// button would be the one thing in the card not following the cascade.
///
/// **28 px is under the 48 px tap target Material asks for**, and it is the
/// prototype's number. It is a secondary affordance inside a card that is itself
/// usually tappable; the size is the spec's and is flagged here rather than
/// quietly widened, because widening it would move every panel's head.
