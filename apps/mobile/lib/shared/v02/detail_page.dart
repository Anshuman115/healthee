/// The frame every pushed v02 screen shares: no app bar, a `.page-header.detail`
/// inside the scroll, and the page's own padding.
///
/// `richer.css`: `#main { padding: 20px 16px 112px }`. The app's own rung for the
/// same measure is `Insets.lg` / `Insets.xxl`, which is what `InstrumentScreen`
/// spends and therefore what a pushed screen spends too — one page rhythm, not
/// two.
///
/// **No `AppBar`.** `instrument_screen.dart` argues it for the tabs and the same
/// argument holds here: the prototype's detail screens open with their own back
/// control and a 23 px title inside the scroll, and a Material bar above that
/// would be the screen's name twice and 56 px spent on the second one.
///
/// ## Back pops, and lands on the screen's home tab when there is nothing to pop
///
/// This used to read `canPop() ? pop : null` — **no control at all** on an empty
/// stack. Every one of these screens is normally pushed, so the arrow was there
/// whenever anyone looked; a deep link, a notification or a restored process
/// opens the same screen with nothing underneath, and the owner was then stuck
/// on it. `core/parent_tabs.dart` carries the prototype's own answer
/// (`app.js::H.back`) and the reasoning.
///
/// The decision is made **when the control is pressed**, not when it is built:
/// the stack a page sits on can grow after its head is laid out, and a captured
/// `canPop` would send the owner to a tab from a screen that had since become
/// poppable.
