/// .list-row              { display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 12px;
///                          width: 100%; min-height: 72px; padding: 16px 20px;
///                          text-align: left; }
/// .list-row + .list-row  { border-top: 1px solid var(--line); }
/// .list-row strong       { display: block; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 700; }
/// .list-row small        { display: block; color: var(--muted);
///                          font-size: 11px; white-space: normal; }

///
/// ## The title is `Expanded`, the chevron is not, and that pairing is the trap
///
/// `.grow` is `flex: 1; min-width: 0` on the middle column while the tile and the
/// chevron are `flex: 0 0 auto`. Written as a `Row` of three children the middle
/// one must be `Expanded` — **not `Flexible`**. A loose `Flexible` beside another
/// flexible child splits the free space instead of taking the remainder, which is
/// how `chapter.dart` ellipsized every heading on the installed build. Here the
/// two outer children are fixed-size, so `Expanded` is unambiguous and the
/// subtitle wraps rather than truncating: `white-space: normal` is set on
/// `.list-row small` explicitly, against the row's own `nowrap` inheritance.
///
/// ## The row declares a tone and passes no colour
///
/// `H.row(...)` writes `data-tone` onto the anchor, and `[data-tone] .icon-tile`
/// then resolves `--family`/`--family-soft`. So the row wraps itself in a
/// [ToneScope] and [IconTile] reads the cascade — the same contract every panel
/// uses. Every settings row in the prototype resolves to `fitness`, which is the
/// `:root` default, so [tone] is normally left null.
