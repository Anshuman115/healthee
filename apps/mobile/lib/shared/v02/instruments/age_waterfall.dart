/// The prototype's own note, from `README.md`: *"The biological-age waterfall

/// ## The excluded term is the whole reason this is a bespoke instrument
///
/// Three states look identical to a bar chart and mean three different things:
///
///   * **measured, and it moved the estimate** — a bar, and its size is the size
///     of the effect;
///   * **measured, and it moved nothing** — a 3 px stub labelled `+0.0y`. The
///     term was computed, the answer was zero, and that is a finding;
///   * **excluded** — the term could not be converted into years at all. It gets
///     **no bar of any height**, the word `excluded`, and the running level
///     drawn straight through it, because a zero-height bar reads as the second
///     case and it is not.
///
/// `age_instruments_test.dart` mutation-tests exactly that boundary: rendering
/// an exclusion as a minimum-height bar must fail the suite, because a stub
/// passing as an exclusion is the failure this instrument exists to prevent.
///
/// ## The ladder is not snapped to the estimate
///
/// The steps are drawn from the deltas and the estimate bar is drawn from the
/// estimate. When they reconcile, the last connector arrives exactly at the top
/// of the estimate bar; when the server's numbers disagree, the connector
/// arrives somewhere else and the reader can see it. Snapping the ladder onto
/// the estimate would draw a reconciliation that had not happened.
