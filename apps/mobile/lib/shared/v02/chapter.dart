/// **The nav's `position: sticky` IS reproduced.** It was skipped once, on the
/// grounds that a sticky header inside a `ListView.builder` means a
/// `SliverPersistentHeader` and a different scroll structure for the whole
/// screen. That is true, and it is what `shared/instrument_screen.dart` now
/// builds: a section declares [ChapterNav.extentOf] as its pinned extent and the
/// shell splits its list around it. Lazy building — and therefore reveal-once —
/// is unchanged, because a `SliverList.builder` destroys off-screen items on
/// exactly the same terms.
///
/// A pinned header covers the top of the viewport, so a jump has to land its
/// target BELOW it. `.chapter-heading { scroll-margin-top: 66px }` is the CSS's
/// answer and `today_chapters.dart` is ours — it subtracts this control's own
/// measured height rather than a number typed twice.
///
/// The prototype colours the FIRST button and no other, which reads as "you are
/// here" and is wrong the moment you scroll. [ChapterNav] colours [selected]
/// instead, which is the same pixels for the same default and correct after a
/// jump.
