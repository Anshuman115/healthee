/// [Fold] — the app's one open/close transition.
///
/// ## Why it exists
///
/// `reasoning_note.dart` and `insight_card.dart` both fold with a bare
/// `if (_open)`, so the body appears and disappears between one frame and the
/// next. The owner, looking at a third surface built to match them: *"then the
/// idiom is wrong we need swift animation"*. They are right — an instant swap
/// gives the reader no signal that the content went somewhere retrievable
/// rather than being replaced, which is the whole difference between a fold and
/// a state change.
///
/// ## ⛔ Not `AnimatedSize` — that is what made it stutter
///
/// `AnimatedSize` animates by **re-measuring its child every frame**. The body
/// behind this fold is a column of markdown paragraphs, so each frame of the
/// transition re-laid-out the whole analysis, and the owner's verdict on the
/// device was *"animation is still not smooth"*.
///
/// [Align.heightFactor] is the cheap reveal, and it is what Material's own
/// `ExpansionTile` uses: the child is laid out **once**, at its natural size,
/// and the parent simply takes a fraction of that height while a [ClipRect]
/// hides the rest. Nothing is measured again mid-flight.
///
/// The clip is not optional either way — without it the paragraphs paint
/// outside the panel and over whatever card is beneath it.
///
/// ## An explicit controller, so there is no animation on arrival
///
/// `TweenAnimationBuilder` animates from its `begin` on the first build, so a
/// panel that starts open would unroll itself every time the screen is built.
/// The controller is seeded at its resting value instead and only ever moves
/// when [open] actually changes.
