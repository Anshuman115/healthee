/// The ring around the avatar — the whole of Today's connection chrome.
///
/// **Legacy draws this ring** (`app/lib/ui/today_screen.dart`: a 46 px
/// `CircularProgressIndicator` behind `HAvatar` while a sync runs). What it did
/// not draw is the full-width "Connected · Sync now" strip this app had above the
/// scroll, or the 7 px dot beside the date that replaced it. Both are gone; the
/// geometry legacy wrote is unchanged, and the ring now carries three more
/// things than "something is happening".
///
/// ```text
///   idle              a thin ink3 circle          nothing is running, no session
///   connected         a full accent circle        a session is open right now
///   syncing           an accent arc               determinate where the fetch says so
///   needs attention   a full ink circle           something is wrong; the card says what
/// ```
///
/// ## What the ring may and may not claim
///
/// **It is a status indicator, not a control.** Tapping the avatar opens
/// Settings, exactly as before; this widget contributes no gesture. Pull-to-
/// refresh is still the manual sync path.
///
/// **A ring cannot say "your token was rotated" or "22,000 measurements are
/// waiting".** So it is deliberately not the surface a fault is *reported* on —
/// every loud `ConnectionHealth` state is written out in full on the data-health
/// card, which sits four lines below this row in legacy's own section order. The
/// ring's fault state is a pointer to that card, and its semantic label says so.
/// Colour is never the only carrier: `README.md` would be right to call that a
/// claim made in a language with no words.
///
/// ## Why the fault ring is ink and not a warning colour
///
/// `apps/mobile/README.md`: there is exactly one red (`alert`, for illness) and
/// `unf` "is not a warning colour and must never be used as one". A radio that
/// will not connect is not a fact about the owner's body, so it may not spend
/// either. `health_lines.dart` already settled the same question for the card —
/// *"loud and quiet are typography, never colour"* — and this is that rule drawn
/// as a circle: full ink for loud, `ink3` for quiet, the accent for work.
///
/// ## Determinate where the fetch reports it, indeterminate where it does not
///
/// `StrapSyncProgress` is emitted by `StrapSync` per fetch it starts and is null
/// between the handshake and the first one, and during scanning, connecting and
/// authenticating. Those phases genuinely have no fraction, and
/// `ble/strap_progress.dart` is explicit that inventing one is the interface
/// version of a number nobody measured — so they spin, and only a reported
/// fraction is drawn as an arc. *An indeterminate spinner cannot distinguish a
/// working sync from a stalled one*, which is a question that went unanswerable
/// on this project; a determinate arc that stops moving can.
