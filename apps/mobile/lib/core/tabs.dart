/// The tab registry — ONE list, read by the bar and by the router's branches.
///
/// ## Why this is not a constant inside the bar widget
///
/// A `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack` has an ordered list of branches and the
/// bar has an ordered list of items, and the two are joined by **index**:
/// `navigationShell.goBranch(i)` means "the i-th branch", not "the route named
/// on the i-th tab". Two lists in two files joined by an integer is a defect
/// waiting for somebody to insert a tab — the bar would light one screen and open
/// another, and nothing would fail to compile. So there is one list, and the
/// router builds its branches by iterating it.
///
/// That is also why [AppTab.screen] is here rather than a `switch` in the router:
/// a switch over routes needs an unreachable default, and an unreachable default
/// is a runtime error where a missing field would have been a compile error.
///
/// ## Five tabs — legacy's five, verbatim
///
/// `~/projects/healthee-legacy/app/lib/ui/nav.dart` lists them: **Today · Sleep ·
/// Activity · Insights · Actions**. `docs/APP_DESIGN.md` §2 names the same five.
/// This list drew four, and both of the differences were mistakes with reasons:
///
///   * **Coach was a tab.** It is not one in legacy — `main.dart:399` puts a
///     `CoachFab` on Today alone and opens a chat sheet from it — and it is not
///     one here any more (`features/coach/coach_sheet.dart`). The findings that
///     were parked on that tab have gone to **Insights**, which is what §2 called
///     the fourth tab all along and which is where they belong: a correlation is
///     the *evidence* a coach question would be answered from, not the coach.
///   * **Actions was removed for being inert**, and the reasoning was right: a tab
///     is a promise of a destination and there is no wording available inside a
///     10 pt label to qualify one that does not exist, so a dimmed control in the
///     primary navigation was worse than four tabs. The answer to that was never
///     a dimmed tab; it was a screen. `features/actions/actions_screen.dart` is
///     it, and the tab comes back with it — which is exactly the one entry and one
///     branch this docstring said it would be.
