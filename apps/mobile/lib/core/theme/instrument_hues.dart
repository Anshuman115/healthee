/// v02's six category families as a theme extension, plus the ONE canonical
/// sleep-stage mapping every stage plot and legend draws from.
///
/// **This replaced legacy's ten per-metric hues on 2026-09-06.** The prototype in
/// `design/mobile-preview/` assigns meaning to six colours and no more, so the
/// ten collapsed: `hrv`/`readiness` → [fitness], `steps`/`calories` →
/// [movement], `respiratory`/`spo2` → [oxygen], `rem` → [sleep]. `palette.dart`
/// records the collapse; `metric_hue.dart` records which metric lands where.
///
/// **Nothing should read these fields by name.** `tone.dart` is the reader: a
/// card declares a [Tone] and its contents resolve `context.family`. The fields
/// are public only because a `ThemeExtension` cannot hide them.
///
/// ## Why still a second extension rather than fields on `HealtheeColors`
///
/// `HealtheeColors` answers *what surface am I on, what ink do I use, is this
/// reading good or bad*. This one answers *which category is this card about*.
/// Two questions, two extensions, and a reviewer can tell at the call site which
/// one is being asked.
///
/// ## The stage ramp IS v02's — `richer.css`, hex for hex
///
/// [stageDeep] and its three siblings are `--stage-deep`, `--stage-light`,
/// `--stage-rem` and `--stage-awake` exactly as the prototype ships them, in
/// both themes. They were substituted once, on accessibility grounds, for a
/// derived luminance ramp; the owner answered by restating the standing rule —
/// **`design/mobile-preview/` is the specification and we match it** — and the
/// substitution is reverted.
///
/// The measurements that motivated the substitution are **kept in full** in
/// `sleep_stage_palette.dart` and in `test/theme/stage_contrast_test.dart`, where
/// they are now *recordings* rather than gates: the suite prints every pair in
/// both themes and passes. The superseded ramp is kept beside the live one under
/// the same names it always had, labelled as superseded, so the trade stays
/// legible without being re-argued.
