/// ## Why it is not in `palette.dart`
///
/// That file is the v02 token set: every value in it is the sRGB form of an
/// OKLCH token the prototype defines, and it is not free to change. These are
/// not tokens. They are seven accents and three grounds the owner chooses
/// between, authored for this app, answering to WCAG contrast and to being
/// **distinguishable from each other** rather than to `tokens.css`. Two sets of
/// colours with two different authorities and two different tests, so two files.

  /// They are also more saturated than the muted set they replace, and each is
  /// the colour it is named after: Teal was a washed cyan, Berry a dusty rose,

  /// with different names. Clay is terracotta now and Coral is a pink-red.
  ///
  /// Clay and Amber are the tightest pair in the LIGHT column and that is a

  /// browns and not many more. 61 apart is close to the best available.

  /// **Index 0 stays the families' green on purpose.** `appearanceColors` only

  /// would repaint measurements, not chrome.
