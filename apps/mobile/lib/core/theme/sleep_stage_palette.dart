/// **The four sleep-stage colours, and the unrecognised grey.** The second — and
/// only other — file in this app that may hold a colour literal; `palette.dart`
/// is the first, and its library docstring names this one.
///
/// ## What ships: [V02StagePrototype], the owner's own four
///
/// `design/mobile-preview/richer.css` assigns the stages violet, blue, magenta
/// and amber, and **those are the shipped values** — hex for hex, both themes,
/// wired in `instrument_hues.dart`. The prototype is the specification.
///
/// ## What is kept beside them, and why nothing here is deleted
///
/// [LightStagePalette] and [DarkStagePalette] hold a **superseded** luminance
/// ramp that shipped for one month in their place, and everything below is the
/// record of how it was derived and what it measured. It is kept, in full and
/// under its own names, for two reasons:
///
///   * `unstaged` is still live. v02 has no fifth value, so the grey for a span
///     the strap staged with a code we cannot name is still ours to choose, and
///     it is chosen here.
///   * A trade nobody can see the price of is a trade that gets re-made. The
///     numbers below and in `test/theme/stage_contrast_test.dart` are what the
///     v02 set costs, stated once, measured rather than argued.
///
/// **These are recordings, not gates.** No assertion fails on them, nothing warns
/// at runtime, and [kStagePairFloor] / [kStageSurfaceFloor] are reference
/// numbers to measure against rather than thresholds to clear. The owner has
/// answered this question and it is not reopened.
///
/// ## Why the ramp was derived in the first place
///
/// Legacy has no stage palette. `HColors.sleepStage` *borrows* four metric hues
/// — `cSteps` for deep, `cSpo2` for light, `cSleep` for REM, `cHeart` for awake —
/// and the port carried that borrowing over verbatim. On the installed dark build
/// the owner reported the result: *"the sleep graph … looks dull and has
/// accessibility issues, only yellow is visible, others are not."*
///
/// Each of the four cleared the card it was drawn on comfortably; what they did
/// not clear was **each other**:
///
/// ```text
///   dark, against the card #141419      dark, band against band
///     deep   #D9A84E   8.45:1             rem   vs awake   1.02:1

/// Three of the four dark values are **near-isoluminant** — WCAG luminance 0.345,
/// 0.301 and 0.306 — so they differ by hue alone. At 1.02:1 two adjacent bands are
/// the same colour to the eye, and hue-only encoding is also what red-green colour
/// deficiency (~8% of men) removes. WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.11 asks 3:1 of a graphical
/// object needed to understand content, and adjacent hypnogram bands are exactly
/// that.
///
/// Three of legacy's four dark values were near-isoluminant, so an adjacent pair
/// measured 1.02:1 — the same colour to the eye. That is the defect the ramp
/// below was derived to repair, and it is why these numbers are worth keeping
/// even now that the ramp is superseded.
///
/// ## 3:1 on every pair is impossible, and here is the arithmetic
///
/// WCAG contrast is `(Yhi + 0.05) / (Ylo + 0.05)`, so contrast **multiplies** along
/// a ladder: four colours each 3:1 clear of the next need 27:1 end to end. The
/// absolute maximum sRGB offers is 21:1 (black on white), so **no four colours
/// anywhere satisfy it** — before any card or hue constraint is applied.
///
/// Requiring each stage to also clear 3:1 against its own card narrows it further:
///
/// ```text
///   dark   every stage >= 3:1 on #141419  =>  Y in [0.1216, 1.0]   span 6.12:1
///   light  every stage >= 3:1 on #FFFFFF
///          and on the page #F4F4F6        =>  Y in [0.0, 0.2686]   span 6.37:1
/// ```
///
/// A span of 6.12:1 shared over three steps is **1.829:1 per step at best**, and
/// that best spends both endpoints on pure white and a colour at the exact card
/// floor — no chroma left, so no hue identity left. So the honest target is not
/// 3:1; it is *the largest step this palette can reach while every hue survives*.
/// [kStagePairFloor] is that measured number, and it is a floor rather than a pin.
///
/// ## What was derived, and how
///
/// Worked in OKLCH. For each stage: **legacy's hue angle and legacy's chroma are
/// kept, and only OKLCH lightness moves** until WCAG luminance lands on its rung.
/// Chroma is reduced in exactly one place, and only because sRGB cannot hold it at
/// that lightness (light-theme awake, 0.1595 → 0.1185). Every hue angle lands
/// within **0.8°** of legacy's. The four are still amber, blue, purple, red-orange.
///
/// The rungs are geometric in `Y + 0.05`, which is what makes every adjacent pair
/// the same ratio — an arithmetic ladder would have crowded one end.
///
/// ## The ordering, and why it is this one
///
/// **Lightness tracks sleep depth: deep is the lightest rung, awake the darkest**,
/// in both themes. Reading a hypnogram top to bottom — awake · REM · light · deep —
/// the ramp therefore darkens upward, monotonically, in lane order.
///
/// Three reasons, in order of weight:
///
///   1. **Depth is an ordinal scale, so it earns a sequential ramp.** Four hues at
///      one lightness throw that away; that is what shipped, and it is why the set
///      read as "dull".
///   2. **Lane position and lightness then say the same thing.** The hypnogram
///      already encodes depth on its y-axis. Two carriers agreeing is redundant
///      encoding — the thing colour-blind and greyscale readers need — instead of
///      two carriers each doing half.
///   3. **It is the direction legacy's own hues already lean, so it distorts them
///      least.** Amber is the naturally lightest of these four hue families and
///      red-orange among the darkest; legacy's dark set already runs gold 0.433 >
///      blue 0.345 > awake 0.306 ≈ rem 0.301. The ramp decompresses an order that
///      was nearly there and swaps the one pair (rem/awake) that was out of it.
///      Ordering the other way would have forced light-theme deep to a near-black
///      brown at Y 0.012, which leaves the gold family in everything but hue angle.
///
/// `kSleepStages` — deep · light · rem · awake — is already the ramp order, so a
/// stacked proportion bar reads as one monotonic gradient rather than four
/// unrelated blocks.
///
/// ## What did NOT move
///
/// **Every metric hue.** `cSteps` is still `#D9A84E`, `cSpo2` `#7DA3C4`, `cSleep`
/// `#968EC9`, `cHeart` `#E07A5F` — and `cHeart` is still `alert`, the illness flag.
/// Deep sleep and the steps metric used to be one value and are now two, which is
/// the whole reason this file exists: a stage colour and a metric colour are
/// answers to different questions and only one of them was failing.
