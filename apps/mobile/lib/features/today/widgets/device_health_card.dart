/// The operational view: battery, when we last synced, and whether it finished.
///
/// Brief §5.8 calls the freshness strip "the owner-facing operational view" and
/// says why it matters: *"production has served stale data behind a
/// healthy-looking screen before."* This is the strap-only form of it.
///
/// The load-bearing line is the last one. `last complete sync` and `last
/// attempt` are separate stored facts (`SyncKeys`), and this card shows the gap
/// between them out loud when there is one. A partial pull that reported nothing
/// would leave the owner reading yesterday's steps as today's — which is the
/// same failure as a stale server number, arriving from the other direction.
