/// `Insights` — the correlations found in the owner's own data.
///
/// **Ported from** `healthee-legacy/app/lib/ui/today_screen.dart:1512` —
/// `_InsightsSection`, `_describeFinding` (1477), `_trivialFinding` (1497) and
/// `_metricFriendly` (1467). One `Pattern` module per finding, at most four, each
/// with the strength in the header, the sentence at display size, and `rho 0.62 ·
/// 105 days of your data` as its foot.
///
/// ```text
///   PATTERN                                    VERY CONSISTENT
///   When your HRV is higher, your steps are usually higher the next day.
///   RHO 0.71 · 105 DAYS OF YOUR DATA
/// ```
///
/// **Two departures from legacy, both in the honesty layer and both deliberate.**
/// Legacy wrote the letter `r` into that foot whatever statistic it was, and
/// printed the server's raw `description_raw` string as the headline whenever a
/// finding carried one metric rather than a pair. See [findingFoot] and
/// [describeFinding] for what each of those said on screen and why neither is a
/// design change.
///
/// ## The trivial filter is doing real work and is ported exactly
///
/// `_trivialFinding` drops pairs that are definitionally derived from each other
/// — two activity metrics (all of which come from the same step stream), two
/// sleep-dimension metrics, a sleep dimension against regularity, and **any pair
/// with |r| ≥ 0.97**, which legacy annotates `near-perfect = definitional`. Every
/// one of those would otherwise read as a discovery about the owner rather than
/// as arithmetic.
///
/// ## What legacy's sign does and does not say, and why no colour is spent
///
/// The header chip is the accent at every strength and the row draws no verdict
/// colour at all. That is legacy's (`today_screen.dart:1540`), and it is the
/// restraint `apps/mobile/README.md` describes: the sign of a rank correlation
/// says *moved together* or *moved opposite*, which is a direction and not a
/// verdict, and a q-corrected correlation over one person's history cannot
/// support "this is good for you".
