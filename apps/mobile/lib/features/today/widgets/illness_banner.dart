/// The illness flag — the only place in this product that spends red.
///
/// Brief §2: *"Reserve true red for the illness/safety flag alone."* Brief §4.1:
/// *"if present, it outranks everything. Deterministic, safety-critical, not
/// AI."* Both are honoured here and nowhere else.
///
/// [IllnessFlag.framing] is rendered **verbatim**. It is a calibrated safety
/// sentence — "possible early signal", "consider lighter activity" — and the UI
/// layer has no access to the evidence that calibrated it. Re-wording it here is
/// how a hedge becomes a diagnosis or a warning becomes a shrug.
///
/// ## The DATE is on the face, because the flag reaches two days back
///
/// `read/health_metrics.py` selects the newest flag in `[anchor − 2 days, anchor]`
/// and ships `date` precisely so a reader can tell which day it is about. This
/// banner parsed it and drew everything except that — while the framing sentence it
/// prints verbatim is present-tense (*"consider lighter activity today"*). So a flag
/// raised on Monday rendered on Wednesday as advice about Wednesday, with nothing on
/// screen able to say otherwise: stale-as-current, on the one safety-critical block
/// on the Today screen.
///
/// The comparison is `shared/format/other_day.dart`'s — the same one `ActionsSection`
/// already made and the v02 Actions screen now makes. Three surfaces needing one
/// decision is what that file is for.
///
/// ## The deltas are the server's sentence, and only the server's
///
/// The flag is deterministic and the owner is entitled to see what fired it:
/// respiratory rate and skin temperature, each against **their own** baseline, not a
/// population's. That is already in [IllnessFlag.framing], with the WINDOW named —
/// `read/health_metrics.py` builds *"breathing rate +2.4 bpm vs your 14-day
/// baseline"* and records why: `[[respiratory_rate_normal]]` Coach Directive 1,
/// *"never quote a '+X br/min above baseline' without saying which baseline"*,
/// because that note ships **three** baseline windows (14 nights here, 42 days in
/// `recovery_score`, 30 in the anomaly layer).
///
/// This banner used to print that sentence and then print the same two numbers again
/// from the parsed fields, client-side, with the window dropped. A second copy of a
/// number can only ever agree less than the first, and this one broke the directive
/// its own first line exists to satisfy. It is gone (audit C4); the deltas stay on
/// the model, where the ⓘ and a log line still want them.
