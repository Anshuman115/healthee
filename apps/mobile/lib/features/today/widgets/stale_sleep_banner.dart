/// The banner that dates the whole overnight section when last night was skipped.
///
/// **Ported from** `healthee-legacy/app/lib/ui/today_screen.dart:529` —
/// `_StaleSleepBanner`. A 14 px-padded block in `cSteps` at 12% over a 35%
/// border, an 18 px bed icon, and two lines.
///
/// Legacy's own comment says what it is for: when the most recent sleep ended
/// more than 24 hours ago, *every* overnight reading below it — sleep, HRV,
/// SpO₂, breathing, and all of their charts — is from an older night. One banner
/// dates the lot, so the cards under it read as the owner's last sleep rather
/// than as today.
///
/// It is the closest thing legacy's Today has to this product's withheld card,
/// and it is kept exactly as legacy drew it.
