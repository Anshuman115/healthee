/// ## What survived the redesign unchanged, and why
///
/// The **data wiring**. Every figure is still a [Reading] off `TodayFacts`, every
/// block is still gated on what the payload carried, and every refusal still
/// renders as a refusal with its reason. The presentation is new; the honesty
/// layer under it is the same one, wired the same way.
///
/// The **illness banner** stays above everything a number can be read from —
/// brief §4.1 makes it deterministic and outranking, so nothing on this screen
/// may be read before it. It is null on this account today, and null draws
/// nothing.
///
/// **`pai` is null on this account and `anomalies` is `[]` unconditionally**
/// (`read/today.py:83`). Neither gets a section: a heading that can never have
/// content under it is dead code.
///
/// ## The date control, and the one half of the screen it can move
///
/// `.date-navigation` is built (`v02/date_control.dart`) and the header carries
/// it. The selection lives in `data/store/view_date.dart` and follows the reader
/// between screens.
///
/// **A past day now draws the same screen, answered for that day.** `/api/today`
/// takes an optional `day=YYYY-MM-DD` and reads the rows filed under it
/// (`docs/AS_OF_DAY.md`), so recovery, sleep health, debt, VO₂max and biological
/// age are that day's stored values rather than today's relabelled. The refusal
/// this file used to carry was correct while the endpoint answered only for the
/// current day; it is not a refusal we are entitled to any more, because withheld
/// and *not asked for* are different states.
///
/// Nothing about the honesty layer changes with it. A day with no row is
/// `Withheld` with its reason, exactly as an unsynced today is, and every block is
/// still a [Reading] — which is why a past day needed no second set of widgets:
/// the vocabulary that says "we don't have this" already existed and already said
/// it in the right voice.
///
/// **What a past day still refuses is the LLM half**, and that is deliberate
/// rather than pending. The daily action is cached per current day, so writing one
/// for an older date would be authoring a new claim rather than replaying a
/// record; the server sends null and the screen draws nothing, which is the same
/// thing it does for an un-warmed today. The live trust card goes with it — every
/// figure on it is an age measured against right now.
///
/// The prototype's `.scenarioNotice` is its review-scenario switch. The live
/// equivalent is the data-health card, which says the same class of thing about
/// real data, so that is what sits in the slot.
