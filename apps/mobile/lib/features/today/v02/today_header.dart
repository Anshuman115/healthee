/// ## The greeting is gone, the title after it, and now the strip too
///
/// The screen this replaces opened with a two-line 42px *"Good morning, there."*
/// — legacy's `_GreetingHeader`, including legacy's degraded fallback for an
/// owner whose name nothing stores. v02 replaced it with **Today** over the
/// date, and the README records why: *"replaces generic main-screen slogans
/// with direct labels such as Today, Sleep, Activity"*. A salutation to nobody
/// was the largest type on the screen and said the least.
///
/// **Four rows became one, in three steps.** The 27px `Today` went because the
/// tab bar already names this screen, in the accent, with a filled glyph — and
/// because the word was only true until midnight. `dayTitle` folds the title
/// and the date into one control that says **Today** on the newest day the
/// window reaches and names the day on any other, which is the case where a
/// header has something to tell you.
///
/// The device strip went because it ended in `Data & sync ›`, and that is a row
/// inside Settings — a second door to the same place, given a row of its own.
/// The avatar has always opened Settings, so the strap moved onto the avatar.
///
/// ## What is left is two objects, and each is one tap
///
///   * [DayPill] — the day, in a filled pill with a caret, because a date is
///     not a title: it is the one thing on this screen you can change. The
///     month grid behind it replaces two 28px chevrons that moved one day per
///     press.
///   * [OwnerMark] — the strap's glyph, its charge, and the face, opening the
///     screen that holds all three subjects.
///
/// ## The ring stays, because it is the only connection chrome there is
///
/// `sync_ring.dart` is unchanged and still wraps the avatar: one classification,
/// one ring — and it says whether a sync is RUNNING, which is a different
/// question from whether the strap is healthy. That second question is the
/// watch glyph's tint, and it is `fav` only when the link is actually quiet. A
/// green watch beside a strap that has not been heard from in two days is the
/// flattery this product exists not to do.
