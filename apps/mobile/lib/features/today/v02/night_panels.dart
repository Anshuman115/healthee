/// ## Nothing here composes a sleep score
///
/// `SleepHealthPanel` draws `sleep_health.dimensions` as four **separate**
/// readings against four published cutoffs. It does not add them up, and the
/// prototype's own title says why: *"Sleep health, beyond duration"*. The
/// payload also carries a dimension COUNT (`sleep_health_score_4dim`); it is not
/// drawn as a score anywhere, for the reason `feedback_no_composite_score`
/// gives — three out of four is a tally of unlike things, and a reader will take
/// it for a mark out of four.
///
/// ## The stage chart keeps its pre-v02 painter, deliberately
///
/// `HStackedSleep` is the only stacked stage chart in the app and it already
/// reads `InstrumentHues.sleepStage` for its colours, takes no `Color`, and
/// takes its reveal progress as a parameter. v02 changes what is around it — the
/// panel, the head, the legend, the note — not what it draws. A second stacked
/// painter would be a second opinion about the same seven nights.
