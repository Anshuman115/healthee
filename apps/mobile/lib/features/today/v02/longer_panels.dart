/// ## The rail names its instrument, because VO₂max has three
///
/// `derive/vo2max_tier.py` writes one metric from a graded fit, a heart-rate
/// reserve inversion, or Jurca's non-exercise model, and sends which one it used
/// (`method`, `see_source`, `measured_as_of`, `n_sessions`). All of it is on the
/// panel. An estimate that does not say how it was made is the failure the whole
/// tier system exists to stop, and 43.0 from a graded session is a different
/// claim from 43.0 from a questionnaire.
///
/// `standard_error` is drawn as an error magnitude on the rail and named as one:
/// `Vo2maxRail` calls it an error magnitude, not a confidence interval, because
/// it is a model's published SEE and not an interval computed for this owner.
///
/// ## The journal counts what was logged and never scores it
///
/// Caffeine, meditation and an open fast are a **log**, not a judgement. The
/// panel prints the counts and the link to add another, and says nothing about
/// whether the day was a good one.
