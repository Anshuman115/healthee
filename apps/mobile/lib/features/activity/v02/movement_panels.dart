///

/// H.panel('Today’s movement','movement', value + bars + three stats, 'metric/steps','walk')
/// H.panel('Your week, by intensity','movement', value + bars + three stats + note + evidence, 'metric/mvpa','walk')
/// ```
///
/// ## The step chart here is a WEEK, not the day's buckets
///
/// Today draws `today_step_buckets` — fifteen minutes to a bar. This one draws
/// `H.demo.activity.steps.trend.slice(-7)`, one bar per day. They are different
/// claims about different windows and neither substitutes for the other, which
/// is why the two screens do not share a panel.
///
/// **The payload has no `steps_total` sparkline** (`sparklines` carries eleven
/// ids and that is not one of them), so on today's contract this chart draws
/// `ChartVoid` — nothing, at full height. That is the correct render of a series
/// the server did not send, and it is the reason nothing here pads a series to
/// reach seven bars.
///
/// ## What stays on the card
///
/// Which of the strap's TWO step numbers this is. `steps_card.dart` spent a
/// docstring on it and the memory index carries it as #121: the strap keeps a
/// since-midnight counter and a per-minute buffer that this firmware freezes
/// mid-day, and the number here is the counter. That is instrument naming, so it
/// stays where the number is (`metric_detail.dart`'s line).
