/// `Where today's heart rate sat` — the Edwards zones behind the load figure.
///
/// ## Shipped, parsed, and drawn nowhere
///
/// `cardio_load.zone_minutes` has been on the wire since the endpoint existed
/// and `ActivityToday` has parsed it into `CardioLoad.zoneMinutes` the whole
/// time — nothing rendered it. Legacy's Activity screen had a
/// `Heart-rate zones · today` card; the rebuild dropped it. Prod carries the
/// flag on all thirty of the last thirty days, so this is not a slot waiting
/// for data.
///
/// ## The zones are Edwards', and the boundaries are stated
///
/// `derive/cardio_load.py` cuts at **50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 % of HRmax**, and
/// HRmax is Tanaka 2001 (`208 − 0.7 × age`) rather than the 220-minus-age rule
/// of thumb. Both facts belong on the card: a zone chart whose boundaries are
/// unstated is five bars the reader cannot check, and the same minute lands in
/// a different zone under a different HRmax.
///
/// **When the payload sends [CardioLoad.hrmax] the bands are named in beats**
/// as well as percent, because a boundary in bpm is one a reader recognises and
/// a boundary in percent is one they have to compute.
///
/// ## Waking minutes only
///
/// `derive_cardio_load` skips asleep minutes, so these are the minutes of the
/// day the owner was up. Said on the card: without it the totals look short
/// against a 24-hour day and the reader has no way to know why.
