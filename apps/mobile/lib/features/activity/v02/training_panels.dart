/// ## Two substitutions, recorded where they were made
///
/// **The prototype's `7-day / 28-day` pair is not on the wire.** `cardio_load`
/// carries `load` (today) and `baseline_30d`, and nothing else that averages a
/// window. Drawing a "7-day average" from the thirty-day trend would be a second
/// definition of the owner's habitual workload sitting next to the server's, free
/// to disagree with it — CLAUDE.md's one-definition rule is exactly about that.
/// So the ratio names the terms it actually has.
///
/// **The prototype's `Ratio 1.0` is unconditional.** Here it appears only when
/// `baseline_30d` came with it: a ratio against a baseline that is not there is a
/// 1.0 meaning "we had nothing to compare with" and reading as "you are exactly
/// at your normal load".
///
/// ## The error figure is an error MAGNITUDE
///
/// `standard_error` is a model's published SEE, not an interval computed for this
/// owner, and `Vo2maxRail` draws it as a magnitude and says so. That wording is
/// load-bearing and is asserted by `test/mutations.sh`.
