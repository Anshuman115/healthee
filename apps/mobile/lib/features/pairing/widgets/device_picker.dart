/// The account's straps. Tap one.

/// One `.card.flush` with hairline-divided `.list-row`s, never a card per
/// device — a list of two devices rendered as two cards is a card inside a card,
/// which the design forbids, and `FlushCard` draws the rule between rows rather
/// than asking each row to draw its own.
///
/// ## A row that has no name says so
///
/// The Zepp payload is not guaranteed to carry a display name, and this work
/// package had no real account to capture one from (`zepp_device.dart`). A row
/// without one shows the MAC as its title and "Zepp did not name this one"
/// underneath. That is worse-looking than printing "Amazfit Helio Strap" at
/// every row, and it is the only honest option: a label is a claim about which
/// device this is, and the wrong one gets the wrong strap paired.
