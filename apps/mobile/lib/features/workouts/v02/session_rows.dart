///
/// ```js
/// H.link('Record a workout','record','button full')
/// <div class="section">
///   <p class="tiny-label">Friday, 31 July</p>
///   <div class="card flush section workout-row">{H.row('walk', …, 'workout')}</div>
/// </div>
/// H.section('Weekly strength', `<div class="card">
///   {45 min Recorded strength activity}
///   <p class="small section">One session…shown separately from active minutes.</p>
///   H.evidence('strength_training_mortality')
/// </div>`)
/// ```
///
/// ## The tile is `--accent` here, and that is a CSS rule rather than a choice
///
/// `H.row` puts `data-tone="heart"` on a workout row (`panels.js::H.toneFor`),
/// which would make its `.icon-tile` red — but `screens.css` overrides it:
///
/// ```css
/// .workout-row .icon-tile { background: var(--accent-soft); color: var(--accent); }
/// ```
///
/// So every tile in this card renders in the accent. [Tone.fitness] resolves
/// exactly `--accent` (`icon_tile.dart` records why), so the rendered result is
/// matched by declaring that tone on the row rather than by teaching [IconTile]
/// a second colour path.
///
/// ## The day caption uses the app's date vocabulary
///
/// The prototype writes `Friday, 31 July`; this app has [prettyDate]
/// (`FRI · JUL 31`) and [shortDate] (`31 Jul`), and a third form would be a
/// third opinion about the same day. The caption is [prettyDate] — the same form
/// every v02 header uses for the day the reader is on.
