/// H.section('Your effort through the run', `<div class="card">
///   <div class="row between">{135 bpm Average heart rate}{badge Peak 168 bpm}</div>
///   H.charts.line(hr_series, {min:60,max:180,start:'07:00',end:'07:30'})
///   <p class="small">Minute averages. Brief low readings remain visible…</p>

///   <p class="small">28 minutes classified…</p>
///   H.evidence('cardio_load_trimp','About training load')

/// ```
///
/// Both are `[data-tone="heart"]` by `H.toneFor('workout')`, so both declare
/// [Tone.heart] once and everything inside resolves it — the trace, the fill,
/// the zone bars. Nothing here is handed a colour.
///
/// ## A GAP BREAKS THE LINE
///
/// The wire is one entry per *recorded* minute, so a stretch the strap did not
/// sample arrives as a jump in `min` and would otherwise be drawn as a straight
/// run between the two minutes either side of it — a heart rate this app never
/// measured, drawn as confidently as the ones it did. [minuteSeries] lays the
/// samples back onto their own minute axis and leaves the unmeasured slots
/// `null`, which is the hole `V02LineChart` breaks its line at.
///
/// ## Why the trace is splined and the zones are not a chart
///
/// Heart rate is a continuous signal sampled once a minute, which is the case
/// `chart_curve.dart` allows a monotone join for; Fritsch–Carlson cannot
/// overshoot the samples, so the curve never draws a beat higher or lower than
/// one that was measured. The zone minutes are **totals**, and a total may never
/// be splined at all — they are bars.
