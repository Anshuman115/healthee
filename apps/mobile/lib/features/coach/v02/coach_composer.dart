/// `.coach-form` — the input, and the cost printed on the control beside it.
///
/// ```css
/// .coach-form       { display:flex; gap:8px; margin-top:24px }
/// .coach-form input { width:100%; min-height:48px; padding:12px;
///                     border-radius:12px; border:1px solid var(--rule);
///                     background:var(--surface); font-size:16px }
/// .form-note        { font-size:10px; margin-block:16px }
/// ```
///
/// ## The one substitution on this screen, and why it is forced
///
/// The prototype's send control is an **arrow with no label**, because a scripted
/// preview costs nothing. A question here costs one of twenty per rolling thirty
/// days, and the rule is that the cost is on the button *before* the tap — a
/// meter at the top of a sheet and a bare arrow at the bottom is still a spend
/// the owner has to remember to have read about.
///
/// So the button carries `Ask — uses 1 of your 17` **and** the prototype's arrow.
/// A label that long does not fit beside an input at 320 px, so the row is
/// measured: it stays the prototype's single row wherever the label and a usable
/// input both fit, and the button drops to its own full-width line where they do
/// not. That is the rendered result of the same CSS at a narrower width, which is
/// the rule for anything Flutter cannot express directly.
///
/// ## It cannot be constructed without a decision about the balance
///
/// [remaining] is `int?` and means *how many are left, or uncapped* — it is never
/// "unknown". A screen that has not read the meter does not build this widget at
/// all; see `coach_screen.dart`.
///
/// ## [initialQuestion] is how a subject reaches the OWNER
///
/// *Discuss this workout* and *Talk this through* arrive as text already in this
/// box — **written, not sent**. Sending it on arrival would spend one of twenty
/// on a navigation, and the standing rule on this surface is that a spend
/// follows a press.
///
/// This is the owner-facing half of a topic and it stays exactly that: a
/// sentence they can read, edit or delete before it costs anything. The server
/// learns the subject separately, through `POST /api/coach`'s optional `topic`
/// field (`coach_screen.dart`); this widget knows nothing about that and does
/// not need to.
