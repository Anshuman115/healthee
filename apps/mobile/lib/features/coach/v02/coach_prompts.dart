/// The openers — chips under a caption, the shape the legacy coach used.
///
/// ## Where this shape comes from
///
/// `healthee-legacy/design_reference/project/screens/v2-coach.png` puts its
/// suggested questions directly under the coach's own message as small pills —
/// *"How did I sleep last night?"*, *"Am I ready for a har…"* — beneath a
/// small-caps `ASK YOUR COACH` caption. They read as things you might say next,
/// which is what they are, rather than as destinations.
///
/// This app has been through three shapes for them and each was worse for a
/// reason worth keeping:
///
/// * **three `.prompt-button` boxes** (the v02 prototype's own) — three borders
///   and three gaps between the masthead and the composer, and they pushed the
///   ask box off the bottom of the owner's phone;
/// * **a `.card.flush` of `V02ListRow`s** — one border instead of three, but that
///   row forces a tone-tinted `IconTile`, so three FITNESS-GREEN squares landed
///   on a screen whose every other accent is amber, and it elides its title at
///   one line, which would have truncated the questions themselves;
/// * **chips**, which is where legacy started. A question is a short phrase, not
///   a row: it wants to sit on the line with its neighbours and wrap when it runs
///   out of room, and it needs no icon at all to say what it is.
///
/// ## Still gated by the balance, and still structurally
///
/// A prompt asks a question, so it spends one of the owner's twenty. [onAsk] is
/// **nullable and required** for that reason and no other: a caller cannot build
/// this widget without having decided whether a question may be spent, and null
/// draws the chips as ABSENT rather than as disabled decoration. `test/mutations.sh`
/// breaks that on purpose to check it is real.
