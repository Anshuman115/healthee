/// Conversations already had — the screen legacy has and this app did not.

/// It exists because a thread used to die with the process: the owner asked a
/// question, the app restarted, and an answer they had been charged one of
/// twenty for was gone with no record it had existed. `CoachHistoryStore` keeps
/// them now; this is where they are read back.
///
/// ## Every row is a conversation, not a question
///
/// The list shows the OPENING question, when it happened, and how many turns it
/// holds. It deliberately does not show the answer: a one-line preview of a
/// grounded reply is the same reply with its citations and its grade floor
/// removed, and that is the one form this app must not render text in. Opening
/// the thread shows the answer with everything that qualifies it.
///
/// ## Reopening continues; it does not fork
///
/// `CoachController.reopen` keeps the stored thread's id, so a question asked
/// after reopening appends to that conversation. The alternative — a copy that
/// drifts from the row it came from — would leave two records of one exchange
/// and no way to say which is the conversation.
