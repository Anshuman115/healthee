/// The server address, an email and a password — signing in, or signing up.
///
/// ## One form, two modes, and why it is not two screens
///
/// The fields are identical and the flow after them is identical: prove an
/// identity, ask the server, mint this device, store. What differs is one call
/// and the words on the button — so a second screen would be this file copied,
/// with the copy free to drift on the promises it makes about where a password
/// goes. The mode is a toggle, and the toggle is a link rather than a tab
/// because signing in is what almost everyone is here to do.
///
/// ⚠ **Creating an account here does not mean this server will serve it.** The
/// identity provider and the deployment are separate gates; an email that is not
/// on the invite list gets a real account and a 403, which the screen reports as
/// `ServerRefusedThisAccount`. The form says so before the button is pressed,
/// because finding out afterwards is a worse way to learn it.
///
/// ## What the form says, in the form
///
/// The same discipline `zepp_sign_in_form.dart` uses: the promise about where a
/// secret goes is on screen next to the field that collects it, because that is
/// where the question gets asked. Here there are two promises and they are
/// different, so both are made: the password goes to the identity provider and
/// never to the Healthee server, and the credential this phone ends up holding
/// is one the server minted for this phone alone.
///
/// ## Why the address is still a field
///
/// This product is self-hostable, and the owner's server is wherever they put
/// it. The identity provider is fixed at build time (`core/env.dart`) and the
/// server is not, so the address stays and the provider does not appear.
///
/// ## The reveal toggle
///
/// Obscured by default, with an eye. Being able to look at what is in the field
/// is a correctness feature rather than a convenience — a mistyped password and
/// a wrong password are the same 400 from the provider, and only one of them is
/// worth resetting an account over.
///
/// **The password is never rendered anywhere but this field.** Not in the
/// semantics label, not in a log line, and not in the state object — see
/// `server_signin_state.dart`, and `test/signin/signin_secrecy_test.dart`,
/// which executes the claim.
