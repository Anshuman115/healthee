/// ⛔ TRANSITIONAL — the server address and a pasted API token.
///
/// This is how signing in worked before there was an identity provider, and it
/// is kept for exactly two people: an owner mid-migration whose phone still
/// holds the old credential, and a self-hoster whose build was compiled without
/// a Supabase project.
///
/// ## What the token actually is, said plainly
///
/// The shared `REALTIME_INGEST_TOKEN`. One string, no identity attached, and a
/// key to one tenant's entire health record — the server maps it to a single
/// sentinel owner and asks nothing else. **Handing it to a second person hands
/// them the first person's data.** The server refuses to boot with it set beside
/// open signups (`core/config.py`), and `docs/MULTI_USER.md` section 4.4a names
/// its removal condition. This file goes when that secret does.
///
/// The form says so, in the form. A control whose danger is only documented in
/// a docstring is documented for the wrong reader.
///
/// ## The reveal toggle
///
/// Obscured by default, with an eye. A token is long, opaque and usually pasted,
/// and the single most common way to get it wrong is an invisible character at
/// one end — so being able to look at what is in the field is a correctness
/// feature, not a convenience. The whitespace that causes that is trimmed
/// anyway (`data/api/server_session.dart`), which is the belt to this brace.
///
/// **The token is never rendered anywhere but this field.** Not in the semantics
/// label, not in a log line, and not in the state object — see
/// `server_signin_state.dart`, and `test/signin/signin_secrecy_test.dart`.
