///
/// ## Two deliberate differences from the prototype's numbers
///
/// **`/api/sleep` now sends the need and the debt** — the same `sleep_debt`
/// block the Today page carries, from the same rows. It used to send neither,
/// and this panel measured its shortfall against `kSleepNeedMin`, a client
/// constant of 480 minutes flat. The server's need is age-selected (NSF 2015:
/// 480 under 65, 450 at 65 and over), so for an older owner the two tabs
/// reported different shortfalls for the same nights and neither said which was
/// which. That is the second definition `CLAUDE.md`'s first hard rule is about,
/// and the constant is deleted rather than corrected: a better client constant
/// is still a second definition.
///
/// **Where the server has no need, this panel says so and draws nothing.** The
/// need band is selected from AGE, so a profile with no date of birth has none
/// — and a shortfall, a performance percentage and a nightly gap are all
/// ratios against it. Withheld with the reason, never computed against an
/// assumed eight hours.
///
/// The shortfall is still summed over the nights THIS SCREEN was sent, not over
/// the server's fourteen, so the third statistic says **`Nights counted`** and
/// carries the count actually used. A `14` here would be a label borrowed from
/// a model that is not running behind it; the server's own 14-night debt is a
/// different figure and lives on the Today page.
///
/// ## The chart is `HDebtBars`, not a second one
///
/// `H.charts.sleepGap` draws each night's bar to what was slept and a dashed
/// ghost from there up to the reference. `HDebtBars` already draws exactly that,
/// takes no `Color`, takes its reveal as a parameter, and is the app's one
/// need-versus-actual chart. A second painter would be a second opinion about
/// the same seven nights.
