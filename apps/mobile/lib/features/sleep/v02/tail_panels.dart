/// The two surfaces the prototype has no box for, rebuilt as v02 panels.
///
/// The prototype's Sleep screen ends at `Naps & your day` and a link to the
/// recommendations. This app's Sleep screen also reaches two server surfaces
/// that the browser mock-up never had to invent:
///
/// - **`/api/sleep/consistency`'s `tonight`** — one lever, a target clock, how
///   often it was hit, and a nap note.
/// - **`/api/sleep/insight`** — a grounded, server-written reading of these
///   nights, citation-validated against `packages/knowledge`.
///
/// Both are kept, for the reason `activity_sections.dart` records for its own
/// `InsightCard`: deleting a reachable server surface because the design
/// mock-up has no box for it is a feature removal wearing a redesign's clothes.
/// They sit **after** every panel the prototype does draw, so the prototype's
/// own order is never interrupted by something it does not contain.
