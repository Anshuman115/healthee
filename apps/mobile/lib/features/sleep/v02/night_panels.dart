/// H.panel('How your night unfolded','sleep',

///      : H.note('No stage timeline recorded for this night.')}${H.stageLegend()}`,
///   'sleep-history','moon')

///
/// where `stageDetails` is `H.sleepStagesTable()` when any stage has minutes and
/// `H.note('Stage durations were not recorded for this night.')` when none does.
///
/// ## The two panels are two different claims and stay apart
///
/// The timeline is *when* each stage happened; the table is *how much* of each
/// there was. The prototype's own note says they can disagree — the strap's
/// staged spans and its stage totals are separate fields on the wire — so
/// putting the totals under the timeline would read as the timeline's own
/// summary. `CHART_COVERAGE.md`: *"Supplied stage totals differ from the separate
/// duration/timeline estimates and that remains disclosed."*
///
/// ## An unstaged night keeps the chart's slot
///
/// A night with no spans draws `ChartVoid` at the timeline's height and says so
/// in words inside the panel. Collapsing the panel would have made a night the
/// strap did not stage look like a night that did not happen.
