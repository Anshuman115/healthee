/// composition list and nothing else (Standards §3). The slicing did not change:
/// the same fourteen nights, the same seven summaries, the same measured-only
/// debt window and the same 18:00-origin timings the pre-v02 screen used, so a
/// chart drawn from these is drawing the same data it always did.

/// Naming them here is also what lets the tests assert the windows without
/// pumping a widget — the seven-night slice appeared three times inline in the
/// screen this replaced, which is three chances for one of them to drift.
