/// The server's metric cards: today's value, a sparkline, and **your** normal.
///
/// Brief §4.1's metric strip and §3's baseline comparison in one card. The
/// comparison is the app's real value — *"Below your usual range of 63 to 79
/// ms"*, your number against your normal, not a population's — so a card with no
/// baseline says so plainly rather than falling silent.
///
/// **One outer card, hairline rows.** Brief §2's first "never" is
/// card-inside-a-card, and a strip of seven framed cards is that rule broken
/// seven times. A withheld row is drawn with an inline [ValueHole] and its
/// reason, in the value's own position, rather than by nesting a `WithheldCard`
/// frame inside this one.
///
/// The `switch` over [Reading] is exhaustive by the language's own rules, so a
/// fifth honesty state stops this file compiling until somebody decides what a
/// row of it looks like.
///
/// ## Every row wears its metric's identity tag
///
/// The label and the area chart take `InstrumentHues.tagFor(card.metric)` rather than
/// the accent. Seven rows drawn in one colour made a strip of seven charts that
/// could only be told apart by reading the label above each; the tag is the same
/// one the grid cell for that metric wears, from the same table, so the two
/// cannot disagree. It is an identity, never a verdict — `palette.dart` argues
/// that at length, and the `σ` sentence beside the number is still the only thing
/// on this card allowed to say how the owner did.
///
/// [_instrumentNote] names the method behind a metric that has a second
/// definition elsewhere in the app. Only `rhr_daily` does today.
