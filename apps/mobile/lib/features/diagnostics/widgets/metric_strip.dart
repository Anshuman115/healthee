/// Every other stream the strap records, one card, hairline rows.
///
/// **One outer card with divided rows, never a card per metric.** Brief §2's
/// first "never" is card-inside-a-card, and a strip of seven framed cards is
/// that rule broken seven times.
///
/// ## Why the rows do not use `WithheldCard`
///
/// A withheld row is drawn here with an inline [ValueHole] and the reason beside
/// it, rather than by handing the row to the shared refusal card. That card is a
/// `StateCard` — a frame — and nesting one inside this frame would be exactly
/// the card-in-card the design forbids. The visual language is kept instead: the
/// same number-shaped hole, in the value's own position, with the reason in
/// [HealtheeColors.ink2] and no colour spent on it.
///
/// The `switch` below is exhaustive over [Reading] by the language's own rules,
/// so a fifth honesty state stops this file compiling until somebody decides
/// what a row of it looks like. That is the type doing its job at the last hop.
///
/// ## A row that shares a name with a server metric NAMES ITS INSTRUMENT
///
/// Two of these streams — resting heart rate and HRV — measure the same quantity
/// as a canonical server metric by a different method, and they disagree by
/// construction. Those rows carry `DeviceStream.instrument` behind the same kind
/// of disclosure the VO₂max card offers for its tiering: one tappable line, the
/// explanation underneath, never a modal. `diagnostics_screen.dart` has the whole
/// trace; a row that omitted the note would be a differently-defined number under
/// a familiar label, which is CLAUDE.md's first hard rule broken quietly.
