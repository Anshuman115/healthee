///
/// ## Three things this card will not do
///
/// **The tone is the rec's own category, never a colour a call site picked.** The
/// prototype hard-codes `data-tone="sleep"` because its fixture is a sleep
/// suggestion; ours reads `category` off the wire. That is data choosing the
/// family, which is the whole point of the cascade.
///
/// **Adopting says intent and nothing more.** The `small` under the checkbox is
/// the prototype's own sentence and it is the honest one — the server records an
/// intention, not a completed action, and `recommendation_history.dart` says so
/// too. A tick that read "done" would be this app inventing an observation.
///
/// **A rec with no server id gets no checkbox.** There is nowhere to write the
/// adoption to, and a control that silently does nothing is worse than none.
///
/// ## Where this card's sources are
///
/// Behind `Why this suggestion` — the prototype's `H.evidence()`, and this
/// card's ⓘ. The action, the rationale and the expected effect are three
/// sentences about ONE suggestion sharing one `research_note_ids`, so they are
/// grounded together and the card face carries no chip at all.
///
/// The link therefore draws for a rec with sources and no rationale, and for
/// neither it draws nothing: an ⓘ opening an empty sheet is worse than no ⓘ.
