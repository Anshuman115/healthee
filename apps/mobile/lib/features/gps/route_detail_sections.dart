/// ## Every figure is the server's, and an absent one is absent
///
/// The summary's fields are all nullable on the wire: a track the server could
/// not compute a pace for sends none. Each stat is therefore built only when its
/// number arrived — `StatRow` lays out the two it was given rather than three
/// with a dash in the middle, because a dash there reads as a measurement that
/// came back empty rather than one that was never sent.
///
/// ## The VO₂max notice is the prototype's own withheld slot
///
/// The fixture route carries the sentence *"This route has one matched
/// heart-rate point. A fitness estimate is withheld until coverage is
/// sufficient."* — the design already treats a missing session VO₂max as a
/// **stated refusal with its reason**, which is what `Reading` does everywhere
/// else in this app. So a real track with no estimate keeps the notice, and one
/// with an estimate replaces it with the estimate **and the instrument that
/// produced it**: `derive/vo2max_tier.py` names its method on the wire, and a
/// number without its method is the flattery mode #108 shipped.
