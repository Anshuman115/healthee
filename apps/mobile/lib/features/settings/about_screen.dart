/// ## The fourth block is a licence term, not a design choice
///
/// Figtree and Inter both ship vendored in `assets/fonts/` under the SIL OFL 1.1, and those
/// terms require the notice to travel **with the fonts** — inside the binary
/// somebody installs, not beside them in a repository. `core/licences.dart`
/// registers the bundled `OFL.txt` with `LicenseRegistry`, and this screen is
/// the only door to the page that renders it. *A registered licence nobody can
/// open satisfies the obligation on paper and not in fact.*
///
/// The prototype has no block for it because a design preview has no binary to
/// ship. So the trust card grows a fourth division, in the prototype's own
/// `h3` + `.small` + `.divider` rhythm, and the door is a `.button.secondary`.
///
/// The version is read rather than written down, and the read is bounded — see
/// `features/settings/app_version.dart`. A host that cannot answer gets the
/// sentence saying so, never a number.
