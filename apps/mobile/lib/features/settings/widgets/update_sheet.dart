/// The sheet that says a newer build exists, the first time the app learns it.
///
/// ## Why this overrides what `update_notice.dart` argues
///
/// That file says a banner would be "an interruption for something that is never
/// urgent", and puts the answer on About. The owner's call is that About is
/// somewhere you have to already suspect an update to visit — a notice nobody is
/// told about is a notice that does not happen — so the app now says it once,
/// unprompted, and then never again for that release.
///
/// Both surfaces stay. This one is the telling; About is the looking.
///
/// ## The three rules it keeps
///
///   * **Only a real [UpdateAvailable] opens it.** `UpdateUnknown` — offline,
///     rate-limited, no release published — opens nothing. An app that
///     interrupts you to say it could not check has interrupted you for nothing,
///     and the honest third answer exists precisely so it is not dressed up as
///     one of the other two.
///   * **Once per release**, recorded when the sheet OPENS. See
///     `update_prompt_store.dart` for why "Not now" is an answer rather than a
///     postponement.
///   * **It never installs anything.** Same limit as the About notice: the
///     button opens the release page, Android's own installer does the rest with
///     its own confirmation and its own signature check. Holding
///     `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` forever for a courtesy notice is not a trade
///     this app makes.
