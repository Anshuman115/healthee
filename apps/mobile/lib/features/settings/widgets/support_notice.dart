/// Where to support this, on the screens that are about the app rather than you.
///
/// ## Settings and About, and nowhere else
///
/// Not Today, not Sleep, not Activity, not Actions. A donation prompt on the
/// screen somebody opened to read their recovery score makes a health app feel
/// like it wants something from them — which is exactly the posture this product
/// is built against. Settings and About are where "which build is this, who made
/// it, how do I support it" already belongs, and somebody on those screens is
/// already asking.
///
/// ## It is the app's own card, not a coloured one
///
/// An accent-gradient panel with its own glass pills was tried here and taken
/// out. Nothing else in this product shouts — Settings is a column of quiet
/// surfaces with one accent glyph per row — and the loudest thing on the screen
/// being the ask reads as a pitch. So this is `PlainCard`, `HButton` and the same
/// ink the rows beside it use: one accent heart, one line, two buttons.
///
/// It sits directly UNDER the owner's own profile card rather than above it. The
/// screen is theirs first; visibility comes from being above the fold, which it
/// still is, and not from going in front of the thing they came for.
///
/// The head is `rowTitle` over `rowSubtitle` — the same pair every `ListRow`
/// below it uses, so the card reads at the size of its neighbours rather than
/// announcing itself.
///
/// ## Three things `oss/sunoh` learned the hard way about UPI, kept verbatim
///
///   * **The link is built as a STRING.** `Uri(scheme:, host:, queryParameters:)`
///     percent-encodes the `@` in a VPA to `%40`, and several Indian UPI apps
///     refuse to parse that. The raw `upi://pay?…` form is the canonical deep
///     link.
///   * **`canLaunchUrl` is not consulted.** It is unreliable for non-HTTP schemes
///     on Android even with the manifest `<queries>` entry, and a false from it
///     forced the copy fallback on phones that *did* have a UPI app.
///   * **`externalNonBrowserApplication`** is the documented mode for a
///     non-browser deep link; `externalApplication` can hand `upi://` to a
///     browser, which cannot pay.
