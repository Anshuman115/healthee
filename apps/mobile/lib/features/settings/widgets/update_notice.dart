/// Whether a newer build is published — shown beside the one you are running.
///
/// ## Here, and not on Today
///
/// The About screen already answers *which build is this?*. "Is there a newer
/// one?" is the same question one step on, and the two belong together: a version
/// number with no way to act on it is trivia. A banner on Today would be an
/// interruption for something that is never urgent — this app is sideloaded, the
/// owner updates when they choose, and nothing breaks if they do not.
///
/// ## The app checks and tells; Android downloads and installs
///
/// Tapping opens the release page in the browser. That is a deliberate limit: the
/// alternative is `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`, a permission that lets this app
/// install packages on the owner's phone, held forever for a courtesy check that
/// runs when they open a settings screen. Android's own installer already does
/// this job, with its own confirmation, and it verifies the signature — which is
/// the check that actually matters (`android/key.properties.example` argues it).
///
/// ## "We could not check" is shown, not swallowed
///
/// An offline phone, GitHub's anonymous rate limit and a repository with no
/// release yet all produce the same honest nothing, and it is said out loud. The
/// tempting alternative — showing "you are up to date" whenever the check fails —
/// is the app reassuring somebody about something it does not know.
