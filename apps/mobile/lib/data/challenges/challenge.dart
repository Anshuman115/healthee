  /// Everything backing this challenge's server-written prose: the inline
  /// `[note_id]` markers in **both** [title] and [why], merged with the
  /// [citations] the payload sent beside them.
  ///
  /// **[why] used to be left out of this, and out of the card's rendering.**
  /// The card drew it with a plain `Text`, so a challenge generated on the
  /// device printed `…the population curve [sleep_duration_mortality].
  /// Maintaining adequate rest aligns with consensus recommendations for
  /// adults [sleep_need_debt].` — raw markers on the face, and the notes they
  /// named reaching no ⓘ. `actions_v02_test.dart` has asserted for the
  /// suggestion card that *"a citation marker is rendered as a source, never
  /// printed"*; this widget was simply outside that gate.
  ///
  /// On the model rather than in a card because three surfaces draw a challenge
  /// — the v02 card, the pre-v02 card and Today's focus list — and one reader
  /// meeting the same commitment on two of them must not be shown two different
  /// sets of sources.
