/// The four-dimension sleep judgement, and the cutoffs it is judged against.
///
/// ## Four judgements. Never one number, in this app's UI.
///
/// The payload carries `score` and `max_score: 4` and it would be trivial to
/// draw "3/4". Brief §5.3 forbids it, and the reason is on the wire itself: the
/// server sends `point_duration` / `point_efficiency` / `point_regularity` /
/// `point_timing` as separate 0-or-1 fields **precisely so the app can show four
/// judgements rather than a fake composite**. Summing them asserts that a night
/// that was long enough but badly timed is "the same as" one that was short but
/// well timed, and nothing in the evidence supports that trade.
///
/// So [dimensions] is the public shape and [score] is deliberately not exposed
/// as a headline. [SleepDimension] pairs each judgement with **its own published
/// cutoff**, taken from the payload rather than hard-coded here — the cutoffs
/// are science, they live on the server, and a copy in the UI is a second
/// definition waiting to drift.
