/// `GET /api/today`, typed — the whole Today screen in one model.
///
/// One model, parsed from the committed contract snapshot, exercising every part
/// of the pipeline: nested objects, lists, nullable fields, and all four honesty
/// states. `test/data/today_snapshot_golden_test.dart` parses
/// `packages/contracts/snapshots/today.json` **directly from the repo** — not a
/// copy — so a reviewed server-side shape change fails the mobile suite in the
/// same commit that makes it. That is the point of the file living where it does.
///
/// ## Every honesty-bearing block is a [Reading], and none of them decide it
///
/// The blocks go through [readingFrom], once, so a metric card and a VO₂max card
/// cannot end up disagreeing about what "withheld" means. A block the server
/// omitted entirely becomes a `Withheld` with the honest "we don't know why"
/// sentence rather than being dropped — an absence the UI never hears about is
/// the silence this whole design is against.
///
/// The fields that are NOT readings are the ones that are not claims about a
/// measurement: [action] (an un-warmed premium surface, not a withheld number),
/// [illnessFlag] (present or absent, never withheld), the series, and the lists.
/// Dressing any of those in a refusal card would tell the owner something is
/// wrong when nothing is.
