/// Biological age — the payload that exercises all four honesty states at once.

/// It is the richest example in the contract snapshot and the reason the union
/// has four cases rather than three:
///
///   * a **value** (34.3 years) — so it is not withheld;
///   * **`caveats`** naming which way the fitness and sleep terms lean — so it is
///     `Caveated`, not `Present`;
///   * an **`excluded`** entry saying sleep regularity cannot be converted into
///     years at all, *alongside* that value — the case that proves an exclusion
///     narrows a number rather than suppressing it;
///   * and a **`withheld`** slot that fires when the inputs cannot carry it.
///
/// The per-lever [contributions] are mandatory for the same reason recovery's
/// factors are: `docs/APP_DESIGN.md` §1 approves biological age as a composite
/// only when it "always renders its per-factor breakdown".
