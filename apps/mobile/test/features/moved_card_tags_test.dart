/// The cards that moved to Sleep and Activity wear their metric's legacy hue.
///
/// Today's cards were retinted when the grid landed; the ones that moved to the
/// two detail screens mostly were not, so Active minutes had no colour at all and
/// cardio load drew a grey chart under a coloured title. A cell and the card it
/// opens in different colours is the identity claim broken on the way through the
/// door. That is what this file still guards.
///
/// ## What it stopped guarding, on 2026-08-05
///
/// It used to assert that **no card title spends `fav`, `unf` or `alert`**, which
/// was the five-tag system's central invariant: tags were built to be 40° clear
/// of every verdict so the two could never be confused. That system is deleted.
/// Legacy — now the specification — makes `cHrv` and `cReady` **the same value as
/// its green**, so a card about HRV, MVPA or sleep health legitimately paints its
/// title in the colour that also means "improving". Keeping the old assertion
/// would fail the port for being faithful.
///
/// What survives is the part that is still true and still breakable: **a hue
/// comes from `hueFor` and nowhere else**, so a per-screen colour invented at a
/// call site fails here rather than looking fine.
