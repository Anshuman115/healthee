/// This file asserts against **the committed contract snapshot's own strings**,
/// not against a fixture written to match the fix. That matters twice over: the
/// lengths below are the real wire (`biological_age` alone carries four
/// disclosures totalling ~2,780 characters), and a server that shortened them
/// would not quietly make this suite vacuous — the premise test fails first and
/// says so.
///
/// The two halves are equally load-bearing and the second is the dangerous one:
///
///   * the prose is **not on the screen**, so the screen is short again;
///   * the disclosure is **still on the screen**, in words, and the prose is one
///     tap behind it. A caveat that became invisible would be a worse failure
///     than the essay, because nothing would look wrong.
