/// Every card on Today that CAN be withheld renders as withheld, with its reason.
///
/// This is the one place the port is deliberately not legacy. Legacy gates each
/// block on `is Map` and draws **nothing** when the server sent none, so a
/// refusal and a bug look identical: an absent card. Every such block is a
/// `Reading` here, and an absent or refused block renders a `WithheldCard`
/// carrying the server's own remedy sentence.
///
/// ## Why this suite is written the way it is
///
/// Each case takes the committed contract snapshot and **removes exactly one
/// block**, then asserts two things at once: the refusal is on screen, and the
/// number that block would have carried is NOT. A test that only looked for the
/// word "WITHHELD" would pass for a card that drew the refusal *and* a stale
/// figure beside it, which is the failure mode the whole `Reading` type exists
/// to stop.
///
/// `test/mutations.sh` breaks the rendering on purpose and fails if this suite
/// does not notice.
