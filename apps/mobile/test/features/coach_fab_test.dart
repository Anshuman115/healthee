/// The Coach button belongs to Today, and to nothing else.
///
/// `~/projects/healthee-legacy/app/lib/main.dart:399` is one line —
/// `if (_tab == 0) return CoachFab(onTap: _openCoach);` — and it is the whole
/// shape this suite defends. Coach was a tab here, which put a chat surface in
/// the primary navigation beside four screens of measurements and left Insights
/// homeless.
///
/// It also checks the tab set itself from the running shell rather than from the
/// list constant: `today_header_test.dart` asserts what `kAppTabs` contains, and
/// this asserts what the owner can actually see and press, which is the thing a
/// wrong branch order would break without changing the list at all.
