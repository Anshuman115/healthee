///
///   * **A REFUSED FIGURE IS STILL REFUSED, WITH ITS REASON.**
///     `/api/activity/workout` is the app's only payload with no honesty
///     envelope, so the pre-v02 screen simply dropped a metric whose inputs were
///     missing and said nothing. `workout_readings.dart` names every one, and
///     `test/mutations.sh` breaks those sentences on purpose.
///   * **No source chip and no reference label on a card face.** The sweep
///     (`citation_sweep_test.dart`) reads `lib/` for the widget; this reads the
///     rendered strings, which is where a raw note id would surface.
///   * **The chart paints at the size it was laid out to**, at four handset
///     widths and never at Flutter's 800 px default.
///   * **The trace never draws a heart rate nobody measured** — the join is
///     monotone, holes break it, and the curve stays inside its samples.
