/// Today's v02 charts PAINT, at the size they were really laid out to.
///
/// Two charts have already shipped at zero height in this repo because a test
/// only checked that the widget existed. `find.byType(V02Sparkline)` passes for
/// a chart inside a `SizedBox(height: 0)`, for a chart with an empty series, and
/// for a chart whose painter returned on its first line. So every assertion here
/// reads the **recorded canvas**: the chart is laid out on the real screen, its
/// painter is replayed at the size the layout gave it, and what it actually drew
/// is counted.
///
/// `test/shared/_chart_probe.dart` owns the recording helpers; `_v02_chart_probe`
/// owns the widget-level ones. This file is about the charts **as Today lays
/// them out**, which is the half neither of those can see.
