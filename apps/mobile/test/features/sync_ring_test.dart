/// The ring round the avatar: what it draws, what it says, and what it is not.
///
/// It is the app's only connection chrome now, so three things about it are
/// claims rather than decoration:
///
///   * **progress is determinate exactly where the fetch reported it.** An
///     indeterminate spinner cannot distinguish a working sync from a stalled
///     one, which is a question that went unanswerable on this project; a
///     determinate arc that stops moving can. Faking a fraction for a phase that
///     has none would put that answer back out of reach in the other direction,
///     so the null case is asserted as hard as the value case.
///   * **each state carries a distinct spoken label.** The strip's headline was
///     carrying that, and four colours are four nothings to a screen reader.
///   * **it is not a button.** Tapping the avatar opens Settings, as it always
///     has, and the ring contributes no gesture of its own.
