/// evidence on the last hop is indistinguishable from a claim that never had
/// any.
///
/// Both directions are mutation-verified:
///
///   * the grounding dropped on the way to the ⓘ fails
///     `THE CITATION SURVIVES AS A SOURCE`;
///   * the raw string rendered instead of the parsed one fails
///     `NO RAW CITATION MARKER REACHES ANY SURFACE`.
///
/// **The sources are read out of the ⓘ, not off the card.** They used to be
/// drawn under the prose; the owner asked three times for them off the card
/// faces, and `citation_sweep_test.dart` now fails the build on any surface that
/// puts them back. So this suite opens the action row's ⓘ — which is also the
/// only way to prove the move did not simply delete them.
///
/// The surfaces driven are every field on the wire a model wrote: `/api/today`'s
/// `action`, and each recommendation's `action`, `expected_effect` and
/// `rationale`. The last is behind a disclosure, so the test opens it — a marker
/// hidden behind a tap is still a marker on screen.
