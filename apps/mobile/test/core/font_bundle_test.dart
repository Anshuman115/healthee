/// **The bundle is what the app asks for** — the gate that was missing.
///
/// Its sibling `typography_test.dart` measures the *face*: tabular figures,
/// glyph coverage, overflow at display size. Every one of those questions is
/// about a font that IS being used. This file asks a question one step earlier
/// and, it turns out, the one that was actually wrong: **is the app being served
/// the face it named?**
///
/// It was not. `HType.number` is legacy's `HType.num` and asks for **w700**;
/// `pubspec.yaml` vendored 400, 500 and 600. Flutter does not fail on a weight
/// it does not have — it substitutes the nearest — so all 74 instrument readouts
/// in the app rendered at 600. Nothing errored, nothing warned, and the screen
/// looked entirely correct while every number on it was the wrong drawing.
///
/// The same class of miss put `FontStyle.italic` on three call sites that
/// rendered upright, because Flutter does not synthesise a slant for a bundled
/// family either. Both are *incomplete font swap*, not design.
///
/// ## Both sides are derived, deliberately
///
/// The weights the app asks for are read by scanning `lib/`; what the bundle can
/// actually draw is read out of the font file. A hardcoded list on either side
/// would have to be kept current by the same person who forgot to add the 700 —
/// which is precisely how the gap opened, and why it stayed open through a port.
///
/// ## The bundle is now ONE variable file, and that changes what to assert
///
/// Figtree ships as a single variable `.ttf`, so "one file per weight" is no
/// longer the question — `fvar`'s `wght` axis range is. A weight outside that
/// range is the same silent substitution the 700 was, so the range is read out
/// of the font's own `fvar` table and compared against what `lib/` asks for.
///
/// A second family, `HealtheeSymbols`, is bundled as the glyph fallback. It is
/// deliberately NOT the theme's family and is excluded here by name.
