/// The face swap, measured rather than eyeballed.
///
/// Inter replaced Instrument Sans (owner decision 2026-08-05: the old face
/// reads "newspaper" at display sizes). A typeface is not a drop-in, and three
/// things could have broken silently:
///
///   1. **Tabular figures.** `docs/APP_DESIGN_BRIEF.md` §7 makes them a hard
///      constraint — "non-tabular numerals in a metric column is a defect" — and
///      a face without a `tnum` table would keep the `FontFeature` and simply
///      ignore it. So this measures two digit strings of the same length and
///      asserts they come out the same width, which is what tabular MEANS.
///   2. **Overflow at display size.** Inter runs wider. The greeting and the
///      hero figures are the strings with the least slack, so they are laid out
///      at the narrowest phone this app targets and checked against the box.
///   3. **A missing glyph.** Instrument Sans had **no U+2082**, so `SpO₂` drew a
///      tofu box on the live screen, and no `σ` for the recovery ladder's caption
///      either. Neither is caught by anything except looking — or by this, which
///      renders each character and asserts it is not the notdef box.
///
/// The fonts are loaded from `assets/fonts/` with a `FontLoader`, so every
/// measurement here is against the real face rather than the test host's
/// fallback.
