/// The two quiet inks a chart draws with: the gridline and the reference line.
///
/// Both owner reports of 2026-08-06 are here: *"can we make the baseline line a
/// bit subtle in the charts as well gridlines are almost white"*. One of the two
/// was a genuine bug and the other was a judgement, and they are asserted
/// differently for that reason.
///
/// **The gridline was a bug.** `h_debt_bars`, `h_timing_chart` and
/// `h_stacked_sleep` each wrote `colors.line.withValues(alpha: 0.5)` — 0.7 in the
/// third — and `withValues` **replaces** the alpha instead of scaling it. That is
/// the exact mistake `chart_primitives.dart`'s `revealed()` exists to prevent,
/// one directory over. `line` is a 10% hairline, so on dark those gridlines were
/// white at 50% and 70%: five and seven times their intended weight, which is
/// what "almost white" was. On light they were near-black by the same multiple,
/// so neither theme was the one that worked.
///
/// **Nothing here pins a value.** Every assertion is a floor or a relationship,
/// because a pinned number fails the build when a value IMPROVES — the mistake
/// this repo has already made on `onAccent`. What is pinned is that the two
/// tokens are the roles they claim to be: `grid` is [HealtheeColors.line]
/// quieted and `reference` is [HealtheeColors.ink3] quieted, so neither can drift
/// into a hue nobody chose.
