/// The sleep-stage set, measured. Every pair, both themes — **recorded, not
/// gated**.
///
/// ## What changed, and why the numbers stayed
///
/// This file used to be a gate. It measured a derived luminance ramp that had
/// been substituted for the prototype's four stage colours on accessibility
/// grounds, and it failed the build on any move back toward them.
///
/// The owner answered by restating the standing instruction — **the prototype in
/// `design/mobile-preview/` is the specification and we match it exactly** — so
/// `richer.css`'s four hues are what ships. The argument is over.
///
/// The **measurements are not deleted**, because deleting them would leave the
/// repo unable to say what the set costs. Every number the gate used to assert
/// is still computed here, by the same code, and printed on every run. What is
/// gone is the assertion: no test in this file fails because a stage pair is
/// close, nothing warns at runtime, and no build gate exists anywhere.
///
/// ## What IS still asserted, and why each one is a fact rather than a taste
///
///   * **The shipped values are v02's, by hex, in both themes.** A stage that
///     drifts one digit from `richer.css` is a port defect; that is the property
///     this file now guards.
///   * **Four distinct colours.** Two stages sharing a value is a hypnogram that
///     cannot be read at all, in any palette.
///   * **The unrecognised grey has no chroma and every stage does.** With the
///     v02 set the separation between a named stage and an undecoded byte rests
///     on chroma and on the legend's word, so those are the two things worth
///     holding — and both are true of the shipped set.
///   * **The superseded ramp still measures what its docstring claims.** It is
///     kept in `sleep_stage_palette.dart` as the recorded alternative, so its
///     numbers are checked rather than left to rot into fiction.
