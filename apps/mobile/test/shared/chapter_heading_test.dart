/// A chapter title takes the width it needs; the rule takes what is left.
///
/// The owner, comparing the prototype with the installed app: *"these header
/// texts in web looks right but in app its getting clipped of or truncated"*.
///
/// `.chapter-heading h2` is `width: auto` and only `.grow` is `flex: 1`, so the
/// title takes its own width and the rule fills the remainder out to the edge.
/// The port wrote `Flexible(title)` beside `Expanded(rule)` — **both default to
/// `flex: 1`** — so `RenderFlex` split the free space equally: on a 390 px phone
/// the title's half is about 148 px and `Last night → today` at 20 px/700/-0.6
/// needs about 160, so every chapter title ellipsized while the rule ran half
/// the row.
///
/// ## The two things this asserts, and why they are the right two
///
/// The bug has two symptoms and a fix that only removes one is still broken:
///
///   * a title that fits is **cut** — because it was handed half the row;
///   * the rule is **short of the edge** — because it was handed the other half
///     and a loose `Flexible` never gives its surplus back.
///
/// The second is the one that discriminates at any width and in any font: with
/// the equal split, `Expanded` gets exactly `free / 2`, so the row's children
/// end before the content edge. `rule.right == content edge` is false under the
/// bug and true under the fix, for every title and every width.
///
/// ## Two things about the harness
///
/// `flutter test` pumps an **800 px** viewport, which is wider than any handset,
/// and the defect is invisible there because half of 800 is enough for anything.
/// This project has already shipped one layout defect for exactly that reason.
/// So every case here pins a real handset width.
///
/// It also renders with the **test font, whose every glyph is one em wide** — so
/// `Patterns → small changes` measures ~480 px here against ~250 px on a device.
/// That is why the real titles are exercised on the graceful-degradation path
/// and a short title carries the fits-exactly path: the assertions are about the
/// LAYOUT RULE, which is what actually changed, rather than about whether one
/// particular string happens to clear one particular width in one font.
