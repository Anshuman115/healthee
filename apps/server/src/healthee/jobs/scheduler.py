"""In-process scheduler — ticks, and runs each owner's chain at THEIR local fire time.

Replaces the legacy ``scheduler.py`` cron loop with the structural change the rebuild
mandates: it does NOT ``subprocess.call(["healthee", …])``. Each owner's chain runs
in-process through ``chain.run_chain`` — supervised, so a failure is logged and
Telegram-notified rather than lost (standards §2: "no ``subprocess``/``Popen`` for
in-process work — jobs run as supervised functions").

## The model: tick + the per-owner per-day marker (Phase 6.4c, MULTI_USER.md §6)

The loop does not compute "the next fire instant" and sleep to it. It **ticks** on a
bounded interval and, on every tick, asks of each active owner: *is it past their
local fire time, and has their chain not already run for their local day?* If so, run
it. Idempotence is not the loop's job — it belongs to ``run_chain``'s per-owner
per-day dedup marker (the folded ``kv`` PK), which is what makes this safe by
construction: a missed tick, a container restart, a slow run, or an owner who signed
up after their own fire time all resolve correctly on the next tick.

**Why not a next-fire timer** (the trap this design exists to avoid): a
"compute the next matching instant, sleep, fire, repeat" loop returns *tomorrow* once
an instant has passed. Extended per-(owner) it fires owner A at their 10:30, then
recomputes and sees owner B's identical 10:30 has *just passed* — so B's next fire
becomes tomorrow, and B is silently skipped every single day. Any owner sharing a
fire instant with an earlier-sorted owner never runs. A tick asks a *question about
the present* instead of scheduling a future instant, so it cannot express that bug.

## One chain per owner per local day (the 10:30/10:45/11:00 stagger is gone)

The three staggered timers are collapsed into a single ``run_chain`` per owner per
local day: ``run_chain`` already sequences correlate → recs → warm → briefing *with* the
dependency (a correlate failure skips recs), so the stagger only re-implemented that
ordering with sleep(). It was not spreading LLM load — the steps were fired in the
same fixed order at fixed offsets, and the sweep runs all owners back-to-back within
one timer anyway, so N owners already produced N chains in a burst.

## The clock says EARLIEST; the data says GO (the arrival gate)

``DAILY_FIRE`` (10:30) **in each owner's own timezone** is the earliest the chain may
start, never the instant it does. Reaching it is one of two conditions; the other is
``data_gate.day_data_arrived`` — something MEASURED on the owner's day is actually in
the database. There is no global fire zone (the old ``TZ``): an owner's
``app_user.timezone`` is the only zone in play for them.

Until this gate existed, this docstring claimed 10:30 was chosen as "late morning,
AFTER a typical late wake + app push, so recs/briefing don't compute on last night's
not-yet-synced sleep". Nothing checked. The app's auto-sync fires only on a foreground
transition, so an owner who had not opened the app by 10:30 had handed us nothing since
yesterday — and the chain ran anyway, writing recommendations and a briefing about a
night no row described, then setting the per-day marker so the real sleep arriving at
noon got NO chain at all. A comment about a clock was standing in for a check, which is
the failure class this codebase keeps finding in itself; ``jobs/data_gate.py`` opens
with the evidence.

**The gate can stay shut all day, and that is an outcome, not a hang.** A day nothing
arrived for gets no chain and no briefing, because "not enough data" beats an
optimistic guess and a briefing about an unrecorded night is the guess. What it must
never be is *silent*: past ``QUIET_DAY_NOTICE`` the owner-day is reported to the
Telegram health surface once — once, not once per tick — so a strap that stopped
syncing surfaces as itself instead of as a product that quietly stopped speaking.

Two consequences worth naming rather than discovering:

* a sync landing at 23:55 local still runs that day's chain on the next tick — the loop
  asks its question every tick, so late is late, not lost;
* a sync landing after local midnight does NOT retro-run yesterday. The marker and the
  question are both per local day. Yesterday's briefing delivered tomorrow is not a
  briefing, and authoring a past day's analysis now is forbidden anyway
  (``docs/AS_OF_DAY.md`` section 6, and ``recs.generate_recs`` refuses the call).
