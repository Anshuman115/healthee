"""The supervised event chain — replaces the legacy shell ``Popen``.

Legacy triggered ``subprocess.Popen("healthee correlate && healthee recs && "
"healthee daily-insight", shell=True)`` from two sites (api/app.py:933,
v2/api.py:74). A failure in any step vanished into the shell — the classic
swallowed-error class the rebuild exists to kill.

The steps themselves live in ``jobs/steps.py`` (this file owns order, supervision and
idempotence; that one owns what each step is). Here they run IN ORDER as in-process
function calls, each wrapped by
``_run_supervised``: a failure is CAUGHT, logged with context through
``core.logging``, and reported to Telegram via ``core.notify`` — never silently
passed (standards §1: "Background/silent contexts … must report failures to their
health surface"). The chain then applies dependency logic:

  * ``illness`` runs FIRST, because it is the only step anything below it READS.
    ``challenges`` consults the flag twice in the very next step — ``advance_due`` via
    ``challenges/recovery_guard.py`` ([[recovery_readiness]] D7: may an adopted target
    be RAISED?) and ``finalize_due`` via ``challenges/confounds.py`` (was the owner ill
    inside this outcome's window?). Written after them, today's flag misses both: the
    adapter ratchets a training target on the morning the owner got sick, and the
    ledger records that day's outcome as unconfounded;
  * ``challenges`` depends on nothing computed here — closing out a commitment that
    ended last night, and moving a program ladder on from it, is not downstream of
    any computation, and an owner whose findings failed still deserves an honest
    outcome for it (WP-C2/WP-C4; the choice to finalize here rather than inside a
    list read is argued in ``challenges/lifecycle.py``);
  * a ``correlate`` failure ABORTS ``recs`` AND ``warm`` (both read the findings
    correlate writes, via the choke point's context) — they are marked skipped, not
    run on stale inputs;
  * a ``briefing`` failure does NOT undo the recs already persisted;
  * a ``warm`` failure costs only the coaching lines — the chain continues.

## Which steps a free owner gets (Phase 6.6a, MULTI_USER.md §12.3)

Three of the six steps call a model, and generating output nobody is entitled to see
is the cost hole 6.6a exists to close (``PRICING.md`` §6.1: at 5 % conversion each
premium user carries ~19 free ones, so free-tier cost control is existential). So
``recs``, ``warm`` and ``briefing`` are SKIPPED for a non-premium owner — named as
``skipped``, never silently absent, because a step that did not run and a step that
ran and produced nothing are different facts (standards §Errors).

The other three run for everyone, and the line between them is *what the step costs and
who the output belongs to*, not "is it in the AI half of the product":

* ``illness`` is the deterministic early-warning flag, and the one step that could never
  be gated on any grounds. ``PRICING.md`` §1a is explicit — "never paywall data or
  safety" — and this is the safety half of that sentence: an unentitled owner still gets
  the pill saying their overnight vitals moved, and their live challenges are still held
  back while it is up. It also spends no tokens.
* ``correlate`` is the **deterministic** FDR correlation + cutoff engine. It spends no
  tokens, and its findings are a FREE-tier feature (``PRICING.md`` §1a: "personal
  findings … ✓ shown as plain stats"). Skipping it would take a free feature away in
  the name of saving money it does not cost.
* ``challenges`` closes out commitments that ended last night and moves a ladder on —
  also deterministic, also free to run. The challenges *system* is premium, but an
  owner whose subscription lapsed with a live commitment still deserves an honest
  outcome for it rather than a challenge frozen mid-window forever. Bookkeeping that
  already-generated content is entitled to is not the same as generating more.

The check is one lookup per owner per chain, from ``core.entitlement`` — the same
function the HTTP gate uses, so the endpoint and the job can never disagree about who
is premium (§12.7's invariant is enforced at both, from one source of truth).

``warm`` is the step that makes the read surfaces' LLM lines exist at all: the
``/api/today`` action and the sleep-tonight line are cache-only on the read path
(``coaching.cached_line`` never generates, standards §Performance), so without an
off-read-path warmer they are null forever. It runs here, once per owner per THEIR
local day, because that is the one place that already knows both.

Since #95 ``warm`` also generates the **briefing body** — one call produces it and the
daily action together (``insights.morning``), so ``briefing`` below usually sends warmed
text and spends nothing. That does NOT make ``briefing`` depend on ``warm``: when ``warm``
was skipped (a ``correlate`` failure) or its merged call could not ship, ``briefing``
generates for itself exactly as it did before. The order of the two steps is unchanged and
still only ``warm`` → ``briefing``, which is the order that lets the second read what the
first wrote.

The chain is deduped per day via the ``kv`` table: once a day's chain has run its
generating steps, a second ``run_chain`` for that day is a no-op (legacy deduped
on last-night's sleep landing). That marker is what lets the scheduler tick
repeatedly and still run each owner's chain exactly once per their local day
(6.4c) — it is the whole idempotence story, so the scheduler owns no dedup of its
own.

## The marker is a HIGH-WATER MARK — one row per owner, not one per owner per day

It stores the LATEST local day this owner's chain has run for, in the kv **value**;
the key is a constant. It used to put the day in the key (``job:chain_done:<day>``),
which left one row per owner per day in ``kv`` forever with nothing to sweep it —
365 rows/owner/year of pure bookkeeping on a table read on every tick. `0012` folded
the accumulated rows into one per owner and this module stopped making more, the way
``core.rate_limit`` (which documented the divergence rather than copying it) already
does. Standards §Performance: unbounded data is windowed.

The shape carries a semantic, not just a smaller row count. "Has the chain run for
day D" is answered as ``stored >= D`` — *the chain has run THROUGH D* — and the write
is a ``greatest()``, so the mark can never move backwards. Three consequences, all
deliberate:

  * a later day is un-marked and fires; the same day twice is a no-op (idempotence,
    unchanged);
  * a run for an EARLIER day is deduped away rather than re-generating and re-sending
    a briefing for a day already past. ``force=True`` is the escape hatch, and it is
    the only caller that ever wanted one;
  * a forced back-fill cannot regress the mark and so cannot un-dedup today — with a
    plain overwrite it would, and today's chain would run (and spend) twice.

ISO-8601 dates are fixed-width and zero-padded, so lexical order **is** chronological
order — the property that lets both comparisons happen in SQL on a TEXT column.
