"""The chain's steps — thin adapters onto the modules that do the work.

Split out of ``jobs/chain.py`` when the illness producer made it a sixth step and
pushed that file past the 400-line gate. The seam is a real one rather than a size
dodge: this module answers *what each step is and what it costs*, ``chain`` answers
*supervision, order and idempotence*. A seventh step lands here and only its name and
entitlement class touch ``chain``.

Every adapter takes the same ``(day, user_id, tz, *, client)`` shape so ``chain`` can
supervise them uniformly, and each names ``_day``/``client`` with a leading underscore
or an ``ARG001`` waiver where it genuinely does not use one — an unused parameter that
is deliberate must look deliberate.

``chain`` imports these by name into its own namespace, so a test that stubs
``chain.step_recs`` still stubs what the chain calls.

    This is where auto-completion lives, rather than inside the challenges list read
    the way legacy did it (``challenges/lifecycle.py`` argues the choice). It depends on
    nothing the chain computes: closing a finished commitment is not downstream of
    correlate, and an owner whose chain failed on findings should still get an honest
    outcome for the challenge that ended last night.

    Advancement (WP-C4) is the same step and the same transaction, deliberately. A
    program rung IS one of the challenges ``finalize_due`` just closed, so its terminal
    status and whatever the ladder does about it — promote, deload, hold, stop — are one
    fact about one night. Splitting them would let a rung be recorded ``expired`` while
    the ladder's answer to that failure rolled back, which is the half-state the freeze
    is written in-transaction to avoid.

    rungs' stored statuses rather than re-scoring them, so running it before the close
    would simply find an active rung and do nothing (``challenges/ladder.py``).
