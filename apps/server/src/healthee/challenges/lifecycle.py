"""The challenge state machine: ``suggested → active → completed | expired | abandoned``.

WP-C2 (CHALLENGES.md §4). WP-C1 made a challenge *scoreable*; this makes it a thing
an owner can take on, be measured against, and have honestly closed out.

## Four decisions worth reading before changing anything here

**0. Two rules bound what may be adopted, and they are different rules.** The cap
(:data:`MAX_ACTIVE`) is about how many commitments one owner can hold; the duplicate
check (#72, ``challenges.commitment``) is about whether the thing being adopted is a
*separate* commitment at all. They refuse under different reasons because a surface has
to be able to tell an owner "you are full" from "you are already doing that".

**1. The cap is per OWNER.** Legacy's `_MAX_ACTIVE = 3` was global because legacy
had one user; here it counts the caller's own active rows and nobody else's
(MULTI_USER.md §2). A cap that leaked across tenants would let one owner's
enthusiasm lock every other owner out of adopting anything.

**2. A challenge ends early only on an IRREVOCABLE outcome; otherwise it ends when
its window does.** A `>=` total, once reached, cannot be un-reached, so it closes
the moment it is met. A cap, once blown, cannot be un-blown, so it closes then too.
But a cap that is merely *un-blown so far* proves nothing until the period is over
— the owner still has the rest of the day — so it waits for the window. This is the
one place that distinction matters: ``evaluate``'s ``complete`` answers "is the rule
satisfied right now", which is the right thing for a progress card and the wrong
thing to freeze a ledger on.

**3. A window that ran out UNMET is `expired`, never `completed`.** Legacy marked a
timed-out program rung "completed" (CHALLENGES.md §2.3). A system that records
failures as successes cannot learn from either.

## Auto-completion runs on WRITE paths, never on a read — deliberately

Legacy auto-completed lazily inside its list read (`challenges.py:635`). That works,
and it is the reason we do not do it:

* a GET that writes is not idempotent and not cacheable, it takes the read path's
  budget (standards: p95 < 100 ms) into an UPDATE, and two concurrent list requests
  race to close the same challenge;
* a challenge only closes if somebody *looks*. The owner who stops opening the app —
  precisely the one whose challenge is quietly expiring — never gets an outcome,
  so the ledger silently under-records exactly the cases it most needs.

So finalization runs in two places, both of which are already writes:

* :func:`finalize_due` as a step in the nightly chain (``jobs/chain.py``), once per
  owner per THEIR local day, so it happens whether or not anyone looked; and
* at the start of :func:`adopt`, because the ``MAX_ACTIVE`` cap is computed from the
  active count — a challenge that finished but has not been closed yet would block
  the owner from starting a new one, with no way for them to fix it.

Reads (:func:`list_challenges`) stay pure.
