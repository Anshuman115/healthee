"""Row access for `challenge` — the standalone lifecycle's half of the challenge SQL.

Split from :mod:`healthee.challenges.lifecycle` so the *rules* (when may a
challenge be adopted, what ends it, what does the owner see) read as rules rather
than as SQL with rules mixed in. Everything here is owner-scoped: every statement
carries ``AND user_id = %s`` even though `0008`'s RLS would also filter it, because
the explicit predicate is the clarity and the index use, and RLS is the backstop
(ENGINEERING_STANDARDS §2; the AST guard in ``tests/db`` fails the build without it).

Nothing here decides anything. A function that answers "should this happen" belongs
in ``lifecycle``; a function that answers "what is stored" belongs here.

## The one other place challenge SQL lives, and why it is not here (WP-C4)

``program_store`` writes ``challenge`` rows too — the rungs of a ladder. That is a
deliberate exception to "one place", taken because the alternative is worse: every
ladder operation spans BOTH tables in one breath (activate a rung *and* clear the
program's hold; insert a deload *and* renumber the rungs after it), so splitting by
table would put one logical write in two modules and leave neither readable.

What must NOT be duplicated is the row SHAPE, and it is not: :data:`COLUMNS`,
:data:`SELECT` and :func:`row` are public for that module alone, so a column added by
a future migration reaches both readers or neither.
