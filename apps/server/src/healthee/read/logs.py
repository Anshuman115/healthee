# and then rendered verbatim into EVERY prompt the product builds
# (``insights/context_sessions.manual_entries_section`` → ``insights/context.build_context``
# → both ``grounded_ask`` and the coach). Standards section 2: "Request bodies are ALWAYS
# pydantic models — validation at the boundary is what keeps a bad value out of the
# science layer." These fields had no bound of any kind, so 200 rows of arbitrarily long
# notes was the whole prompt budget — a denial-of-wallet against a $0.179-a-question
# surface, and the budget the corpus is competing for (``insights/retrieval``: the
# evidence block is "65–83 % of every prompt", and it is the part that gets squeezed).
#
# ⛔ A bound is the ONLY thing done to this text. It is not filtered, rewritten,
# stripped or refused for its content — it is the owner's own journal and their own
# record. What an instruction inside it can and cannot reach is handled where the
# prompt is BUILT (the data fence in ``manual_entries_section``), never in storage.

# The numbers are chosen to be invisible to a person writing a journal and fatal to a
# prompt-sized paste: 4,000 characters is roughly 700 words on one entry.

    This model had ``max_length`` on its four strings (see the block above) and NOTHING
    on its four numbers, while ``read/gps_request.py`` — a phone upload of the same
    trust level, one directory over — bounds its payload to the millimetre. The sharp
    one is ``type: "weight"``, which writes ``amount`` into ``weight_log.kg``: a
    ``numeric(5,2)`` column, so an unbounded float was a database error before it was
    anything else, and the value feeds BMI, VO2max and biological age. A NaN or a 1e308
    weight was accepted by this endpoint.

    The bounds come from ``core.bounds``, the same module ``ingest/models.py`` uses, so
    the two routers that write ``weight_log`` cannot disagree about what a weight is.
