"""Which configurations this server REFUSES to boot on, and why each one.

Split out of `core/config.py` when the auth audit's two new refusals (B1, C3)
pushed that file past the 400-line gate. The seam is a real one rather than a place
to put the overflow: `config.py` answers *what the environment holds* — the fields,
their defaults and the two conninfo helpers — and this answers *what combinations
are not a deployment*. They change for different reasons, and the arguments below
are long precisely because each one is a decision somebody will want to reverse.

Every function here raises `ValueError` and returns nothing useful, so the
validators in `config.py` stay four lines each and read as a list of the ambiguities
this codebase refuses. Plain functions over primitives rather than a mixin: a mixin
would have to re-declare the fields it reads, and two declarations of a settings
field is the shape of problem this file exists to refuse.

The house rule they all follow: **an ambiguity is refused, never interpreted.** A
setting with two possible readings and no way for the operator to see which one was
taken is how a dead subsystem, or an inert isolation guarantee, survives for weeks
behind a green /healthz.

    A blank `POSTGRES_APP_USER` means the request/job pool connects as the
    owner/admin role, and a superuser ignores every policy `0008` creates —
    `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` does not bind it either, and `0008` deliberately does
    not FORCE. So in that state RLS, the backstop underneath every explicit
    `AND user_id = %s`, is decoration. This product is MULTI-TENANT, so that
    backstop is the isolation guarantee, not a nicety.

    Until now it was announced by one WARNING at pool open, and **both shipped env
    templates defaulted to the unsafe side** — an operator who copied a template and
    filled in what was obviously required got the RLS-inert configuration and a log
    line. Whether the live deployment was in that state was, at audit time, an open
    question nobody could answer from the repository.

    ### Why refuse-to-boot rather than "make the fallback impossible where tenants
    exist"

    Both were on the table. The tenant-count check has to run against the database
    at pool open, which means it can only fire AFTER the deployment is already
    serving — and worse, the dangerous moment is when a SECOND owner signs up, on a
    process that booted safely and is still running. A check that cannot see the
    moment it exists for is not the guarantee it looks like. This one fires at boot,
    in front of the operator, before a single request; it needs no database; and it
    is the shape `config.py` already uses three times over
    (`_require_app_creds_together`, `_require_model_ids_when_ai_key_is_set`,
    `_require_an_ordered_zoom_range`) — an ambiguity refused rather than
    interpreted.

    ### And why there is an opt-out at all

    The bootstrap really is two deploys (`infra/DEPLOY.md` §B2): the role cannot be
    provisioned before the deploy that provisions it, so step 1 MUST be bootable on
    the admin creds. Refusing outright would make the documented procedure
    impossible. `ALLOW_ADMIN_DB_FALLBACK=true` keeps step 1 working while turning
    the transitional state into something written down in the deployment's own env
    file, where the next person can see it — instead of the absence of a value,
    which looks identical to never having been considered.

    A blank model id is not a default, it is a dead subsystem: the id is forwarded

    the coach, and the nightly recs/briefing chain. Nothing in the deploy can see
    it. `/healthz` is a liveness+DB probe, so it goes green; the LLM failures land
    in Telegram and the scheduler log. Prod ran in exactly this state.

    **Fail fast, not warn.** The admin-creds fallback used to be the contrasting
    precedent here — a documented, deliberately-transitional step of a two-deploy
    bootstrap (`infra/DEPLOY.md` B2) that had to stay bootable. The auth audit
    settled that differently: `_refuse_an_unasked_for_rls_bypass` above now refuses
    it too, and the bootstrap stays bootable by ASKING for the transitional state
    (`ALLOW_ADMIN_DB_FALLBACK=true`) rather than by leaving a variable blank.

    There is no deploy order, no bootstrap and no
    migration in which "key set, model id blank" is correct, which makes it the
    same shape as `_require_app_creds_together` above: an ambiguity to refuse, not
    an interpretation to pick. Refusing turns it into a *deploy-time* failure, in
    front of the operator, instead of a silence discovered weeks later.

    `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` blank and this never fires. The check only triggers on a
    state the operator explicitly asked for and then half-configured.

    Deliberately NOT mirrored into `/healthz`: with this validator the state cannot
    exist in a live process, and a probe that 503s on a config problem would let
    Docker's healthcheck restart the container into the same config forever —
    trading a dead AI layer for a flapping read API, which is worse than the
    disease. Config correctness belongs at boot; `/healthz` stays a signal an
