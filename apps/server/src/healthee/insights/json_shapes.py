"""Which JSON payloads the validator knows how to read, and which of their fields are prose.

Split from :mod:`healthee.insights.validator` on the seam the two already had: that module
owns the RULES (grounding, tone, certainty, grade calibration), this one owns the
per-surface DECLARATION of what user-facing text a payload contains and how each field is
grounded. They change for different reasons — a new honesty rule edits the rules, a new
JSON surface edits this table — and the validator was at the file gate.

## A shape that is not here FAILS CLOSED, and that is the point

Before challenge generation existed, an unrecognised payload produced zero segments,
``validator._run_rules`` then had no text to check, and it returned ``ok=True`` with no
citations — a total validation bypass reachable by any future JSON surface that forgot to
register itself. :func:`segments_for` returns ``None`` for a payload it cannot read, and
the validator blocks on that, which is the only safe reading of "I do not know what this
is".
