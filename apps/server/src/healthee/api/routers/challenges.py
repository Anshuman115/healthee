"""Challenges — the feed, the lifecycle writes, and the outcome ledger.

Thin (standards §2): auth dep → one domain call inside one owner-scoped transaction
→ shape the response. There is no business logic and no SQL here; every rule lives in
``healthee.challenges``.

Two things this router deliberately does NOT have:

* **A target in any request.** ``POST …/adapt`` takes no body. The recalibration is
  recomputed server-side from the owner's own rows at the moment of the request
  (CHALLENGES.md §5.2) — a client may ask for one, it can never dictate the number,
  and the way to guarantee that is to give it nowhere to put one.
* **An ungated identity.** Every handler takes ``ChallengeUser`` (``api.gate``), not
  ``CurrentUser``: the whole challenges system is premium per PRICING §1a, so a
  non-premium owner gets **402** here — including on the pure feed reads, because a
  stored challenge is AI-authored content and §12.7's "read pre-generated AI content
  from another path" loophole closes at whichever endpoint serves it. The gate is on
  the identity rather than beside it so an endpoint cannot take the owner without
  taking the gate (6.6a).

## The response models (standards §2 — small, stable payloads are typed)

These five payloads are small and stable, so they are pydantic models rather than
``dict``; the aggregate exception (``/api/today``, ``/api/sleep``) does not apply. The
models below **describe** the wire, they do not reshape it. Three rules keep that
true, and breaking any one of them moves the wire under a client already parsing it:

1. **Field order and optionality mirror the source.** :class:`Challenge` follows
   ``store.COLUMNS`` and ``db/schema.sql``'s NOT NULLs exactly; :class:`Outcome`
   follows ``ledger._READ_COLUMNS``.
2. **A nullable field is required-and-nullable, never defaulted.** ``x: T | None``
   with no ``= None``: the key must be present and its value may be null. A default
   would let a *missing* key serialise as null — and a non-optional field with a
   default (``adherence: float = 0.0``) would turn "this cadence makes no per-day
   commitment" into "they adhered 0 % of the time". This product distinguishes no
   data from zero and from not-applicable; the models have to as well.
3. **``extra="forbid"`` everywhere.** A response model silently DROPS keys it does
   not declare, so a field added to ``evaluate_challenge`` would vanish from the wire
   with nothing failing. Forbidding extras turns that into a loud error in the first
   test that runs — the trade this codebase always makes.

    for ``weekly``/``total``: a cumulative rule makes no per-day commitment, so there
    is no rate of keeping it (``ledger._adherence``). Nothing here may default it.

    ``difficulty`` is a WIRE ADDITION (#62). ``ledger._compute`` wrote it on every row

    is here rather than deleted because a met ``stretch`` and a met ``gentle`` are not
    the same result, and the rollup that groups outcomes by it is planned (WP-C6's
