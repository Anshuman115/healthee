"""Dependency readiness — GET /readyz (no auth). Separate from /healthz on purpose.

## Why not just extend /healthz

``/healthz`` is what the container healthcheck and nginx act on. Its 503 means *restart
me / take me out of rotation*, and that is the only thing it may ever mean. Teaching it
about OpenRouter would make a provider outage restart our API in a loop — trading a dead
AI layer for a flapping read API, which is strictly worse. ``core.config``'s
``_require_model_ids_when_ai_key_is_set`` already records this argument in its own
docstring; this endpoint is the other side of it.

So the two probes are split by *who acts on them*:

* ``/healthz`` — liveness + DB. An ORCHESTRATOR reads it. Contract unchanged.
* ``/readyz`` — every dependency this deployment needs to be fully itself, the AI layer
  included. A HUMAN or a monitor reads it, and nothing restarts because of it.

## It costs nothing per probe

The rule that shaped this endpoint: a health check that makes a paid LLM call per probe
is a worse bug than the one it detects. Nothing here calls a model.

* the transport signal is a passive read of ``insights.transport_health``, which is
  filled in by traffic that was going to happen anyway;
* the balance comes from ``insights.credits``, whose endpoint is free and whose reading
  is TTL-cached, so hammering ``/readyz`` cannot amplify into outbound calls.

## What it reports, and what it deliberately does not

No dollar figures. This endpoint is unauthenticated (nginx proxies ``/`` wholesale, so
anything mounted here is public) and the account's economics are nobody else's business;
the amounts go to the operator's Telegram channel and the logs instead. The body carries
the STATE — ``ok`` / ``low`` / ``exhausted`` / ``unknown`` — which is what a monitor
needs to act, and no model id or key can appear in any of it.

## 503 only for the two states that are really broken

The DB being unreachable, or the AI layer being demonstrably dead (transport ``down``,
or a balance measured at zero). Never for ``degraded`` (a blip), never for ``unknown``
(no evidence either way), and never for ``low`` (a warning, and the layer still works).
A probe that 503s on uncertainty is a probe that gets ignored.
