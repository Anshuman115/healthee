"""The four dormant consumers, driven by a flag the PRODUCER wrote.

Every one of these read paths shipped, was reviewed, and has never once seen a real
row — the table only ever held rows a test put there by hand. So each assertion here is
of the form "run the producer, then ask the consumer", never "insert a flag, then ask
the consumer": a fixture that writes the row itself cannot tell you the producer's
output has the shape the consumer expects.

The four:
  * ``read/health_metrics.illness_flag_payload`` — the Today pill and its deterministic
    framing sentence;
  * ``read/recovery.recovery_score_payload`` — the guidance override (C3's fix);
  * ``challenges/levers.analyse`` — [[recovery_readiness]] D7's hard training override;
  * ``challenges/confounds.illness_days`` — the outcome ledger's illness-day count.

Plus the one that is not a consumer but a policy: an UNENTITLED owner's chain must still
run the step (6.6a's gate is live, ``PRICING.md`` §1a never paywalls safety).

Anchored on the owner's REAL local today, because three of these five read the wall
clock — an active flag is one within ``_ILLNESS_ACTIVE_DAYS`` of *now*, and a fixed date
would make them assert nothing.
