"""#95 — the briefing and the daily action are ONE generation, rendered twice.

The whole point is a number: **one** LLM call where there were two. So the assertions
here are call counts against a counting stub, not step statuses — an implementation that
generated twice and threw one away would report identical statuses while spending exactly
the money this change exists to save (the same argument ``tests/premium/test_chain_spend``
makes for the free tier).

The second subject is the coupling, which is the risk the saving is bought with. Merging
two surfaces into one call means one failure could dark both, and a silent coupling that
halves availability to save money is not a win. So these tests pin the invariant the
design rests on: **the merged call is an optimisation, never a dependency** — when it
cannot ship, each surface still produces exactly what it produced before #95.
