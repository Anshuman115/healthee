"""C2 · `send_briefing` may only stamp a message with the day its content answered for.

``day`` reached exactly one thing — the ``healthee briefing — {day}`` header
``_compose`` prints — while every input is unconditionally today's: ``cached_line`` is
keyed on the owner's own today and takes no day, and ``morning.generate_briefing``
anchors on ``user_today(tz)`` throughout.

So ``run_chain(user_id, tz, day=<past>, force=True)`` sent **today's judgement under an
older date**, over the one channel where the reader has no other date beside it to check
against. That is the stale-as-current lie ``docs/AS_OF_DAY.md`` section 3 names, and
``jobs/recs.py`` has refused its own version of it since B2 —
``tests/jobs/test_recs_day.py`` is this file's sibling and its argument applies verbatim.

No database, no Telegram and no model: the refusal is the first thing ``send_briefing``
does, which is itself the property worth pinning. A check that runs after the message
has gone out is a different check.
