"""Fixtures shared by the two scheduler suites.

A ``conftest.py`` rather than importing the fixtures from ``_sweeper_bed``: pytest
discovers fixtures by name from here, whereas importing one puts a second binding of
the same name in the importing module — which is a redefinition to the linter and a
fixture that shadows itself to a reader. The non-fixture bed (the owners, the fake
chain, the fake gate) stays in ``_sweeper_bed`` where it can be imported explicitly.

Both are opt-in: a test in this directory gets them only by naming them.
