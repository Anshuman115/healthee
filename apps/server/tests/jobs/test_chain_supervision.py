"""The crux WP8 test: the supervised chain never swallows a step failure.

Pure control-flow (no DB, no LLM): the step functions and the kv dedup
marker are stubbed, so these prove the supervision contract exactly —
  * a step that RAISES is caught, reported to Telegram, and returned as `failed`
    (NOT silently passed, NOT crashing the process — the legacy swallow is dead);
  * `illness` runs FIRST — it is the only step anything below it reads, and
    `challenges` consults the flag it writes in the very next step;
  * `challenges` runs before correlate and depends on nothing — a correlate failure
    must not reach back and skip closing out a commitment that already ended;
  * a `correlate` failure ABORTS `recs` AND `warm` (both read its findings);
  * a `briefing` failure does not undo the recs that already ran;
  * a `warm` failure is non-fatal — it costs the coaching lines, not the briefing;
  * a second run for the same day is a deduped no-op;
  * a NON-PREMIUM owner's chain runs the three deterministic steps — `illness` among
    them, because safety is never paywalled — and calls none of the three that cost
    tokens (6.6a — the cost hole, MULTI_USER.md §12.3).

Entitlement is stubbed alongside the dedup marker so these stay pure control-flow: the
real `is_premium` reads the `subscription` table, and a DB lookup in here would make a
file whose whole subject is branching depend on a seeded database.
