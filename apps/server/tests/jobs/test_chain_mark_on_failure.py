"""What the dedup marker means when a step fails — one case per step (B1).

The marker used to advance on ``correlate`` alone, under a comment describing "the
generating steps" that silently annexed the two steps above it and the one below. So:

* a failed ``illness`` was recorded as done and never retried — and
  ``derive_illness_flag`` is not part of ``derive_batch``, so ``db/rederive.py`` cannot
  rebuild what that lost. The day's answer was gone permanently;
* a failed ``challenges`` was likewise marked done and simply skipped;
* ``briefing`` ran AFTER the mark was written, so a briefing failure could never be
  retried however the rule above was written.

``tests/jobs/test_chain_supervision.py`` proves each step's failure is *reported*;
this file proves it is *not forgotten*. They are separate files because they answer
different questions and because the supervision file is already at the size gate.

Same pure control-flow bed as its sibling: every step and the marker are stubbed, so
these assert branching and nothing else.
