"""The chain's dedup marker against a real database: one row per owner, forever.

`tests/jobs/test_chain_supervision.py` stubs the marker to keep the branching tests
pure control-flow, so nothing there can see the marker's actual SHAPE. That shape is
the subject here, and it is a correctness question twice over:

  * **idempotence** — the marker is the whole reason a five-minute tick is safe
    (`MULTI_USER.md` §6: "Idempotence is the marker's job, not the loop's"), so a
    change to how it is stored has to be re-proved per owner, per THEIR local day,
    and across a day boundary;
  * **growth** — the old encoding put the day in the KEY and left one row per owner
    per day in `kv` forever (16 of them live on prod, one per day since the cutover).
    The row COUNT is therefore an assertion, not a detail: it is the whole fix.

Auto-skips without a reachable TimescaleDB (same policy as the other integration
tests).
