"""The jobs half of the invariant: a free owner's nightly chain spends ZERO tokens.

This is #48 — the cost hole — measured end to end against a real database, the real
``run_chain``, and a stubbed model whose CALL COUNT is the assertion. ``PRICING.md``
§6.1: at 5 % conversion each premium user carries ~19 free ones, so a chain that
generated for everybody would put the free tier's marginal cost above the premium
tier's profit.

Why the call count and not the step statuses: an implementation that ran ``recs``,
``warm`` and ``briefing`` and threw their output away would report the same ``skipped``
outcomes while spending exactly the money this exists to save. ``tests/jobs/
test_chain_supervision.py`` pins the control flow with stubbed steps; this pins the
SPEND with real ones.
