"""The challenges router's typed responses: the schema they publish, and the nulls.

``test_contracts`` pins the wire against the committed snapshots and
``test_challenge_endpoints`` pins the behaviour. This file pins the two things that
only exist because the handlers are now pydantic models rather than ``dict``:

* **the published schema.** A ``-> dict`` handler documents its 200 as a bare
  ``{"type": "object", "additionalProperties": true}`` — an OpenAPI generator, a
  client codegen or a reviewer reading the docs learns nothing from it. That was the
  whole reason to type these five, so it is asserted rather than assumed;
* **the honest nulls.** The models are the last thing to touch a value before it goes
  on the wire, so they are the last place a ``NULL`` could be quietly turned into a
  ``0``. ``adherence`` is the case that matters — deliberately null for a cumulative
  cadence (``ledger._adherence``), because a rule with no per-day commitment has no
  rate of keeping it. A model that defaulted it would ship "they adhered 0 % of the
  time" about someone who was never asked to do anything daily.

The last two tests go through HTTP against a real weekly challenge, because the
model-level assertions above cannot see a serializer or a FastAPI response filter.
